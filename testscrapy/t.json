{"headline": null, "content": "Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board say that a fiery gasoline tanker accident that killed a Suffolk County woman last month may have been caused by a common safety problem with tankers that was pinpointed more than a decade ago but has not been corrected.\nThe accident, which was much like one in 1997 that killed a doctor and closed part of the New York State Thruway for six months, happened on Sept. 25 when a woman in a 1993 Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle collided with the side of a tanker that had just delivered gas to a service station in East Islip, N.Y. The resulting explosion forced the evacuation of 100 people from their homes and also burned down power lines nearby.\nFederal investigators stressed that their findings were preliminary, but said they had determined that the crash ruptured a set of unprotected pipes nestled beneath the truck that are used to fill and empty the tank. After pumping, these pipes can still contain as much as 50 gallons of gasoline, and in several similar collisions around the country the pipes have ruptured, spilling their contents and causing an explosion that would not have otherwise occurred.\nIn the East Islip accident, investigators found that the crash also caused a small rupture to the gasoline tank itself, but the charred evidence from the truck and the sport utility vehicle suggests that the gasoline that spilled from the unprotected pipes -- known as wet lines -- may have caused the explosion. ''The wet lines were breached and could have been the source of the fire,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board.\nFederal transportation officials have been aware that the pipes were potentially dangerous since at least 1988. The Department of Transportation issued a regulation in 1989 to try to eliminate the problem in tankers hauling very hazardous liquids other than gasoline, by requiring better shielding of the pipes.\nBut the petroleum industry argued that the risk was too small to justify the cost of such measures for gasoline. And the government granted an exemption, while strongly encouraging the industry to make changes itself to eliminate the danger by installing better protection or a device to pump excess gas out of the pipes and back into the heavily protected tank compartments.\nAfter the 1997 accident, near Yonkers, the safety board determined that if the pipes beneath that truck had not had dozens of gallons of gasoline in them, ''the fire would likely not have occurred.'' And so the board recommended to the secretary of transportation that the department prohibit the carrying of any hazardous materials, including gasoline, in external piping on cargo trucks, an estimated 60,000 of which deliver gas to about 175,000 service stations around the country.\nBut federal transportation officials resisted compelling the petroleum industry to make the change, saying that they were not convinced that it was merited by the number of incidents caused by wet lines.\nPrecise figures are not available about how many fatalities can be directly attributed to ruptured tanker pipes. The Transportation Department has found that 47 tanker truck accidents between 1990 and 1997 resulted in ruptured pipes but also says that some accidents like this may be going unreported. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents 500 petroleum companies, said research done on behalf of the institute in 1994 estimated that ruptured loading pipes had caused, on average, one death every 11 years.\nIn a letter to the safety board in May 1999, Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater wrote that it still appeared to the department that ''a total prohibition of wet lines may not be cost-effective.'' But yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety within the department said that the office expected to begin looking at the issue again early next year, seeking comments from experts and considering changing the rules.\nIn the last several years, a handful of small trucking companies, mostly in the Northeast, have begun to make safety improvements themselves, installing a patented device made by a Brooklyn company, Cargo Tank Concepts, that pumps excess gasoline out of the loading pipes.\nRon Andenmatten, the president of the company, said yesterday that Sunoco Inc., based in Philadelphia, was the only major petroleum company that appeared so far to be planning to make the change voluntarily. The company has bought the devices for 65 of its trucks.\nBP Amoco P.L.C., one of the world's largest oil companies, has also been testing the device on one of its trucks based in California, but the company reported in a recent newsletter that it had decided not to install the devices on all its trucks ''until legislation comes out mandating that the system be installed.''\nMr. Lopatkiewicz, the spokesman for the safety board, said it was not known when investigators, who are working alongside the Suffolk County Police Department, would make a final determination of what caused the East Islip accident. The central question they will be trying to answer, he said, is, ''If the wet lines did not have the gasoline in them, would this accident have had the severity that it did?''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Coach Clive Charles yesterday filled the final two vacancies on his 18-man roster for the Summer Olympics in Australia, naming the United States national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel and the Los Angeles Galaxy rookie midfielder Sasha Victorine to the team.\nThe two players replace the injured goalkeeper Aiden Brown (Colorado Rapids) and midfielder Chris Armas (Chicago Fire). Friedel joins the team as one of three over-age players. The Olympic event is for players under 23 years old, except for three over-age players (Jeff Agoos and Frankie Hejduk are the other two).\nThe addition of Friedel means that Tim Howard, who plays for the MetroStars, is not likely to start for the United States. Howard, who is now the MetroStars' starter because Mike Ammann is injured, will join the Olympic team after Saturday's match against Miami in Florida.\n''I'm not going to second-guess Clive, but we believe that Timmy is clearly ready for the big time,'' General Manager Nick Sakiewicz of the MetroStars said yesterday. ''He has proved that he is capable of starting for the Olympic team. I feel that the Olympic team is not as strong if he doesn't play.''\nFriedel, who played sparingly last season in England for Liverpool and played for the United States national team in its 7-0 victory in a World Cup qualifier against Barbados on Aug. 16, will likely be the starter for the Americans in Australia (the United States opens against the Czech Republic on Sept. 13). The situation leaves the MetroStars without a proven player in goal as the playoffs approach, beginning on Sept. 15 at Giants Stadium.\n''Timmy is not leaving us in the lurch,'' Sakiewicz said. ''We can win and it's not about the vacancy in goal. We made it clear to Tim that we would not make the decision for him. He has an absolute green light to do what he wants. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' JACK BELL"},
{"headline": null, "content": "New players. New attitude. New direction.\nYou guessed it -- same results.\nDisappointing their new owners, 16,297 fans and most of all themselves tonight, the Islanders skated to a 2-0 loss to the Calgary Flames in their first sold-out home opener at the Nassau Coliseum since 1997.\n''We all wanted a Hollywood ending,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said. ''I think we're learning a hard lesson right now; we're learning how hard we have to work to be a successful hockey club. A little more talent doesn't mean anything if you don't apply yourself. ''\nThe hero's welcome for the owners Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates dissipated into frequent boos for the Islanders, who dropped to 0-2-1 on the season as the Flames won their first game in four starts.\n''There was a special feeling generated by the response the fans gave the owners,'' said goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, making his first appearance in an Islanders home jersey. ''We would have liked to put in a better showing.''\nBut the Islanders continue to resemble more of a work in progress.\nDespite a solid game in goal by Vanbiesbrouck, who made 26 stops, the game was a series of missed chances. The Islanders' power play was 0 for 8 tonight to become 0 for the season on 20 chances.\nThe Flames, who had lost their only three games, all at home, came out shooting. The Islanders, however, did not get a shot on goal until more than half the first period had passed.\nThe Flames scored at 9 minutes 18 seconds of the first period when Dave Lowry flicked the puck over the sprawled Vanbiesbrouck on assists from Cory Stillman and the former Islander Niklas Andersson.\nThey went ahead by 2-0 at 14:07 of the second period when Roman Hamrlik fell after he and Kenny Jonsson clipped skates at mid-ice, leaving Stillman wide open to score on the cross-ice pass from Valery Bure. ''I came too far over to his side, and we collided,'' Jonsson said.\nThe Islanders were not without good scoring chances. In the opening minutes alone, Brad Isbister's 30-footer went wide, Dave Scatchard could not tee it up from 10 feet out, and Hamrlik, who made a terrific save in the crease to stop a sure goal while Vanbiesbrouck was caught out of the net, sent a hard shot from the blue line ringing off the crossbar.\nThe Islanders came to life in the third period, holding the Flames to a single shot and sending Fred Brathwaite scrambling to make desperate saves on a dozen shots on goal. But other shots seemed to come a half-second too late and often plunked into the side of the net.\n''We created some chances; we have to move the puck a little quicker,'' Hamrlik said. ''We've had three games, and what we have to do is find a way to score more goals.''\nSLAP SHOTS\nDefenseman YEVGENY KOROLEV, who had not played in the first two games, was assigned to Chicago of the International Hockey League, leaving the Islanders with six healthy defensemen. . . .

{"headline": null, "content": "Riddick (Big Daddy) Bowe is pacing, as if he's warming up before a title fight. A few purposeful steps to the left, then an abrupt turn as if he has reached the ropes. He is not, however, in a 20-foot ring at Caesars Palace. Nor is his left hand sheathed in a 10-ounce glove, ready to inflict damage. No, the left hand of the former heavyweight champion of the world is wrapped in a red sweat rag. It's sweltering inside his 12-car garage, and Bowe, now weighing nearly 300 pounds, daubs perspiration from his brow and stares thoughtfully at his machines: two Mercedeses, a Rolls-Royce Seraph, a BMW 750, a Harley, a Bentley, a vintage 1970 Caddy, a customized Ford Suburban and, Bowe's first car, a 1990 Jeep Cherokee. After a minute, Bowe's small brown eyes widen. He turns to me and flashes the clownish grin -- now made even more impish by the addition of braces -- that delighted and confounded boxing fans just a few years ago.\n''How about if I trade in the Rolls and the BMW?'' he asks. His speech is raspy and slurred, eerily reminiscent of a 40-ish Muhammad Ali, just at the onset of his Parkinson's. ''I never drive the BMW. That's smart, right?''\nI shrug, trying to convey neutrality. Bowe tosses me the key to the BMW. ''Let's roll.''\nBowe rounds up his fiancee, Terri Blakney, and 5-year-old daughter, Diamond, the youngest of his five children, all by his former wife, Judy. They pile into the Seraph, and we're off to the dealership, where a new Rolls Corniche convertible, retailing at $363,000, awaits him.\nBowe, it turns out, bought that same Rolls two days before when the dealer slyly told him that Rock Newman, Bowe's now estranged manager, coveted it. But the next day, Bowe, believing that he'd been played, returned the car, vowing never to do business again with the dealer. Now he has changed his mind again. ''It's a birthday present,'' reasons Bowe, who would turn 33 later in the week.\nSuch behavior might simply be chalked up to the fickleness of the idle rich had Riddick Lamont Bowe not recently been declared brain-damaged in federal court. After Bowe pleaded guilty to abducting his estranged wife\nand their children from her North Carolina home in 1998, he could have been put away for more than two years. But based on the testimony of two doctors, last spring a federal judge sentenced Bowe to just 30 days in prison, as well as six months of house arrest.\nHouse arrest doesn't seem to preclude field trips to the Rolls dealer, though. Or, much to my dismay, reaching speeds of up to 105 miles an hour on Washington's Beltway. Bowe, in his Rolls, bobs and weaves through heavy traffic. Not knowing the location of the dealership, I try to keep up in the BMW, passing cars in the breakdown lane. Motorists swerve out of our path. Some recognize the former champ and wave.\nAfter half an hour, we arrive at EuroMotorcars in Bethesda. Matthew Smith, a slight blond man in glasses and tie, greets Bowe warmly. He expertly removes the tags from the cars Bowe is trading in and ushers him inside to fill out paperwork. Smith gives Bowe $175,000 for the Seraph and $70,000 for the BMW; more than $100,000 less than Bowe paid for the two cars a few months earlier. Things go smoothly until the phone rings. It's the used-car lot across the street. There's damage to the BMW from where Bowe's nephew hit a mailbox. Although it has been repaired, Smith now wants to give Bowe only $66,000.\n''No way, bro -- you give me 70 or put the tags back on the cars and we're out of here,'' Bowe says. He folds his arms across his chest and stares down his opponent. Smith caves. He'll give Big Daddy 70 for the Beemer.\nBowe struts out into the sunlight, and with his massive hands, he stretches open his eyelids so I can see his pupils. ''Now who they saying brain-damaged?'' he whispers triumphantly.\nThe roll of recent heavyweight champs and contenders could be mistaken for a most-wanted list -- Mike Tyson, Michael Dokes, Trevor Berbick, to name a few. Riddick Bowe was supposed to be different: too smart, too talented, too endearing to fall like the others. But Bowe, who is younger than the current champ, Lennox Lewis, hasn't fought competitively for years and probably never will again. His days are passed inside a two-story suburban house, with a small pond out back that holds Japanese fighting fish named Tyson, Evander and Lennox. The shrubbery spells out ''Big Daddy,'' and there's an enormous rec house complete with video arcade and a regulation-size boxing ring. The walls are a shrine with framed relics from the glory days; championship belts, his 1988 Olympic silver medal and 1997 New York tabloid clippings extolling him for retiring with his brains intact.\nBowe proudly gives me the grand tour, then invites me back the next day with just one request. ''Bring videos,'' he implores. ''That's how I pass the time. Comedies, dramas; I watch anything. But don't bring scary. I don't like scary.''\nBowe's home holds plenty of places to watch them. There are big screens in the basement, living room and master suite. Next to one of his VCR's, I find some of his old fight tapes. I ask him if we might watch his final bout, against Andrew Golota. Bowe firmly shakes his head: ''We don't watch that one. Ever.''\nWhy would he? Who wants to relive the moment his life enters a long, irrevocable spiral?\nLike Mike Tyson, Riddick Bowe survived the Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn. Unlike Tyson, he was never a thug. He was the 12th of 13 children, and early profiles made much of the fact that Bowe would walk his mom, Dorothy, to and from her night-shift factory job. As a teenager, he racked up three straight Golden Gloves championships, then scored a silver in the 1988 Olympics. In 1992, Bowe fought Evander Holyfield in an epic title bout that included one of the single best heavyweight rounds ever (the 10th). Bowe won on a unanimous decision.\n''He was 6-5; he could box; he could fight inside; he could do anything,'' recalls his veteran handler Eddie Futch. ''He could have been one of the all-time greats.''\nBowe also possessed a charisma not seen in the heavyweight ranks since Ali. Sitting on his stool right before his 10th-round war with Holyfield, Bowe flashed a wide-eyed goofball smile for the camera. ''People just identified with him,'' says Seth Abraham, who as president of Time Warner Sports signed Bowe to a $100 million contract with HBO. ''He was huggable and appealed to nonboxing fans like an Ali or a Ray Leonard.''\nAfter the Holyfield conquest, the new champ took a trip around the world, meeting with Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II and visiting starving children in Somalia. His manager, Rock Newman, wanted to turn Bowe into a global celebrity like Ali, but it was the beginning of the end. Never fond of training, Bowe had a hard time getting back into shape after the trip. He kept a refrigerator in his bedroom, and his weight swelled to near 300 pounds. For his 1993 rematch with Holyfield, Bowe showed up grotesquely out of shape and lost a close decision.\nThen he began acting strange. At the weigh-in for a 1994 fight with Larry Donald, he punched his opponent in the face for no apparent reason. After an impressive knockout of Holyfield in their 1995 rubber match, he emerged bloated for a July 1996 Madison Square Garden battle with Andrew Golota, a product of Warsaw's mean streets, escaping with a victory only when Golota was disqualified for repeated low blows. After the fight, Bowe's crew incited a riot by attacking Golota. Futch quit, declaring Bowe a lost cause.\nIn the fight's aftermath, Bowe's continued to behave unpredictably. ''He began selling off all his boxing possessions,'' recalls his former wife, Judy. ''Boots, trunks, belts, everything. Things he had promised his kids. People were just marching in and out of the house leaving with all of Bowe's stuff. I think he was in trouble then, but I and everybody else were in denial.''\nBowe became obsessed with joining the Marine Corps, and when he entered the ring for a December rematch with Golota, his trunks had sergeant stripes on them. The fight was disastrous, nine rounds of butchery. Golota gruesomely snapped Bowe's head back and forth, but the ex-champion wouldn't quit. At ringside, HBO's Jim Lampley raved about ''a courageous performance by Bowe, who seems not to have any of his faculties.'' Incredibly, at the end of the ninth round, Golota was disqualified again for low blows. It didn't matter; he had already hit Bowe 408 times, an amount of punishment unheard of at the heavyweight level.\nIn a postfight interview with HBO, Bowe's speech was nearly incomprehensible. Two months later, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. He lasted 11 days. Shortly after, Bowe announced his retirement from the ring. He was 29.\nBowe sits on the floor in the family room as Terri combs out the kinks in his hair. In the VCR is a highlight tape of Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Norton and Holmes. When vintage Ali pops on the screen, Bowe's face lights up. As the Greatest taunts Frazier, Bowe perfectly mouths the words: ''Joe gonna come out smoking, and I ain't going be joking, I'll be picking and poking. Pouring water on his smoking. I might shock and amaze you, I'll destroy Joe Frazier.''\nThe phone rings. Bowe answers: ''World's finest, Big Daddy, here. Be brief.'' He listens a few minutes, grunts, then hangs up. ''Guy wants to invest my money,'' he says. ''All day I get these calls.'' One of the few fighters who seems financially set for life, Bowe doesn't understand the less frugal in his profession. ''You make $1million, you tell me you can't live on the 6 percent -- $60,000?'' Bowe says. ''I once had this brother ask me why I was training so hard. He said, 'You just gonna be back in the ghetto with us.' I'm so afraid of losing my money and seeing him back in the ghetto. It ain't gonna happen.''\nHe turns his attention back to the screen, where the former champions are chatting around a table. Except for Foreman, they're all hard to understand. ''It's funny: listen to those guys, they're all punchy,'' Bowe observes. ''And they did it to each other, punching each other. Ain't it something?''\nFor someone with a diagnosis of brain damage, Bowe has a lucid grasp on the realities of his former profession. ''You realize you're taking a chance,'' Bowe says. ''You may not come out as you went in. You may slur. You may not remember things. That's part of the risk.''\nHis evaluation of his own career is also dead-on. ''Once I won the title and took care of my family, I didn't care as much,'' says Bowe, who bought homes for nearly all of his siblings. ''That's why I respect Ali and Holmes so much: they did it for a long time.''\nHe then asks a question. ''I don't talk that bad, do I?'' I tell him his voice is thicker and raspier than when he was champ. Bowe pauses. ''But that could be caused by a lot of things, right?''\nIt is only when the conversation turns away from prizefighting that Bowe gets fuzzy. Later in the afternoon, after we watched ''Rio Bravo,'' Bowe suddenly stood up. ''Let me ask you a question. How would I go about getting into Spelman College?'' I tell him he'd probably have to go to a community college first. ''What about the Naval Academy?'' I tell him he's too old. He laughs: ''Is that right? You don't think they would make an exception for Bowe?''\nAt Riddick Bowe's sentencing hearing, Dr. Richard Restak, a clinical professor of neurology at George Washington University, was asked to describe the havoc boxing had wreaked on his brain. ''You have what we call cerebral reserve where it's almost like any other kind of reserve, financial reserve or whatever,'' testified Restak. ''You write a certain check, all the money is gone. Same thing here. You take a certain number of punches, particularly if they're in close proximity, then you can have a dramatic falloff in a person's ability to cope.''\nBowe's coping skills were at issue because of his attempt, in February 1998, to reunite with his family. He and Judy had dated since the age of 14, and while their relationship was always turbulent, it disintegrated when Bowe's boxing career did. Judy finally left after Riddick knocked her unconscious in April 1997. ''That was the first time he had ever knocked me out,'' recalls Judy Bowe. ''I remember my youngest boy, Julius, telling the other kids when they came home that 'Daddy killed Mommy.' They had stopped noticing and stopped crying. They were getting used to it way too much.''\nJudy moved herself and the kids to Cornelius, N.C., outside Charlotte. Bowe tried everything to win Judy back. He hung a huge portrait of her minister in his house and sent her a Mercedes truck. When nothing worked, he and his brother Aaron Wright drove to Cornelius on Feb. 25, 1998, prowling the streets until 6:50 a.m., when Bowe spotted his three oldest children at the bus stop. He ushered them into the Lincoln Navigator and headed to their mom's home. There, Bowe ordered Judy, still in her pajamas, and the couple's two smallest children into the car. On the drive north, Bowe opened a bag filled with duct tape, a buck knife and pepper spray and announced, ''I came prepared.''\nIn South Hill, Va., Judy asked Riddick to stop at a McDonald's so that she could get food for their crying kids. In the bathroom, she used her cell phone to call a friend, who notified the police. Judy also called Rock Newman, who promised to check Bowe in for psychiatric testing if she would not have him arrested. The police soon pulled over the Navigator. Judy and the kids were transported home while a limo took Riddick to the hospital.\nFederal authorities in North Carolina brought charges against Bowe (though not against his brother). In June 1998, Bowe pleaded guilty to interstate domestic violence and faced 18 to 24 months in prison. Before sentencing, Bowe's lawyers, including Johnnie Cochran, cobbled together a dream team of doctors. They determined that Bowe suffered from frontal lobe syndrome, a form of brain damage that impairs rational thought and impulse control. In court documents, Bowe's I.Q. was listed at 79, a score bordering on retardation. At the hearing, doctors testified that while Bowe did not have problems with simple everyday tasks, his ability to make wise choices was severely hampered.\nMeanwhile, the former champ was plotting a comeback, skipping rope and hitting the heavy bag. Thell Torrence, Bowe's trainer for the second Golota fight, was flown in for an evaluation. ''He looked real good,'' Torrence said.\nBowe's backers were Jeffrey Jackson, partner in a Washington securities firm that counts Bowe as an investor, and Cecile Barker, a Washington-area software entrepreneur. On Jan. 3, less than two months before his sentencing hearing, Barker sent a letter to HBO announcing, ''Riddick Bowe has decided to end his retirement and return to the ring.''\nJudge Graham Mullen quashed those plans. While he reduced Bowe's sentence to 30 days, he also banned him from the ring for four years.\nBowe seems genuinely contrite about his crime. ''I made a mistake,'' he claims. ''I just wanted to be with my babies.'' About his brain damage, he insists, ''That's something lawyers concocted.''\nOf a postprobation return to the ring, Bowe seems certain. ''You know, I'll only be 36,'' he muses. ''Four years fly by fast.'' He sluggishly shadowboxes in front of the television. ''I mean, I've never done anything else. What else am I gonna do? Get a job?''\nOn a rainy Thursday, Bowe plays Mr. Mom. As part of his divorce settlement with Judy, Bowe gets his kids for the summer, holidays and one weekend a month. He joyfully bounces his daughter Diamond on his knee while supervising the older children's chores. When 14-year-old Riddick Jr. does a halfhearted job of mopping the kitchen floor, Bowe sternly asks, ''Junior, why you play me like that?'' before giving him a hug.\nRiddick has decided to marry Terri, and later in the day, he asks me to come with them as they sign the prenuptial agreement. As we drive in his Ford Suburban, complete with a video screen for every seat, Bowe asks if I know anybody in the media who could cover the wedding. ''I want everybody to know Big Daddy's doing O.K.''\nBowe's wedding is just like the old days. Former members of the entourage whisper into cell phones. Range Rovers and Mercedeses clog his driveway. Adding to the drama, Judy Bowe, there to pick up the kids, is outside, leaning against a van. When Bowe emerges, resplendent in double-breasted black suit and matching alligator shoes, he puts Terri into a waiting limo and saunters over to Judy. For nearly half an hour, as everyone waits and watches, they chat and smile.\nAs the motorcade heads toward the courthouse, Judy calls me on my cell phone. ''Bowe said he'd marry me again if I'd sign a prenup,'' claims Judy. ''He told me he's just getting married because he's bored.'' (When I tell Bowe this later, he smiles and shakes his head: ''Bro, I didn't say that. I was just trying to keep the peace.'')\nThe proceedings are held in a basement before two dozen friends and family. When someone asks Bowe if he's nervous, he answers, ''Nah, bro, this is my second rodeo.'' Everyone laughs.\nThe reception is at Morton's steakhouse in downtown Washington. After the sirloin and shrimp, Jeffrey Jackson, Bowe's would-be promoter, offers a Champagne toast. ''Here's to the once and future heavyweight champion of the world.'' The room goes wild. Riddick Bowe stands up. ''You guarantee me $10 million after taxes and you got it,'' he promises in a voice hard to understand. He throws a couple of lethargic jabs. ''What else I got to do?''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Over a few sultry days in the summer of 1997, the state of Wisconsin got an early taste of the electricity shortages that now threaten several other regions of the country. An unusually large number of nuclear plants that supply the northern Midwest were closed for maintenance just as an unexpected heat wave drifted into the area. Wisconsin Electric, which serves Milwaukee, shut off electricity to 80 businesses; every few hours, it beseeched consumers to limit their energy use.\nWisconsin Electric averted blackouts, but the scare profoundly changed the state's approach to deregulating the power industry, a process it had begun to explore only a year earlier. Like many other utilities, Wisconsin Electric initially pushed for what it and others called the Big Bang: state regulators giving up control over the production and pricing of electricity almost immediately.\nBut after the 1997 power shortage, Wisconsin Electric, along with most local businesses and consumer advocacy groups, began to support a go-slow approach to deregulation, first building in an extra margin of reliable power before encouraging the state to remove its decades-old grip on the electricity industry.\nLately, the rest of the country has been drawing the same conclusion. Just like Wisconsin, several other states have lost their early faith in the instantaneous, smooth creation of a free and fair electricity market. Deregulation has faltered as surging consumer demand outstrips the supply of electricity, and regulators and utilities scramble to cope with successive summers of price volatility and power failures.\nMore than a year ago, the wholesale price of electricity charged by power plants in the Midwest surged to $6,000 a megawatt-hour, compared with average costs of $21 to $22 for the same amount of power. Con Ed customers in New York paid 43 percent more for electricity this June than last year. Prices have spiked elsewhere as well.\nAnd when rolling blackouts rippled through Silicon Valley and electricity bills doubled in San Diego over several weeks this summer, California's pioneering approach to deregulation came to embody what many see as the failings of the process.\nDespite the second thoughts about deregulation, few experts expect a return to the days of strict government control. A world in which various power generators compete openly to provide electricity at market prices still offers the prospect of both lower costs for business and consumers and higher profits for utilities than is possible under the traditional, more inefficient system in which monopoly suppliers are supervised by government regulators.\n''California is an indication to the rest of us that we need to do our homework to make deregulation work,'' said Dick Olson, legal counsel with the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, an association of large companies. ''Some people want to stop the process, but the genie is out of the bottle.''\nBut getting from here to there is proving far more difficult than expected. Lacking a clear federal approach, states are finding their own way and, in the process, casting doubt on some early promises.\n''Deregulation was definitely oversold to consumers by many people,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley. ''To economists and a few others, deregulation was a calculated experiment, and we knew it would have its costs.''\nHistorically, a regional electric utility, which was owned by investors and regulated by the state, generated power, transmitted it over high-voltage lines and then distributed it in low-voltage form into homes and businesses. In broad terms, deregulation calls for separating generation, transmission and distribution into distinct businesses.\nDeregulation advocates argued that if power plants were sold to private owners, they would compete among themselves to sell power to transmission and distribution companies at cheaper prices, driving down the cost of electricity. But that outcome was predicated on the realities of the mid-1990's, when power plants had spare capacity.\nBut with few power plants coming on line recently, particularly in California and the Northeast, deregulation was introduced in the late 1990's at the worst possible time. In the thriving economy, businesses demanded more electricity, and people built bigger homes and bought more gadgets, sharply narrowing the gap between available supplies of electricity and peak demand. Fuel for generation has also become more expensive, especially natural gas, whose price has doubled even as it has grown increasingly popular because it is cleaner than other fuels.\n''I think that the expectation that deregulation will always give you lower prices is unrealistic,'' said John B. Ramil, president of the Tampa Electric Company, a unit of TECO Energy Inc. ''Consumers think that competition will lead to lower prices automatically, when actually they will be paying market prices for power.''\nAdvocates rallied support for electricity deregulation by asserting that it would deliver the choice and the low prices that deregulation of telecommunications has brought. But they forgot that the restructuring of the telephone industry, like power deregulation now, angered consumers early on, when local calling rates rose and the proliferation of choices baffled many people. Lawmakers and regulators took years to iron out the process, which is still going on. And because electricity is even more vital than telephones, there is far less tolerance for interruptions in service and volatile prices.\n''You can't assume that you can deregulate in one year and sit back and watch how things work,'' said Barry Abramson, senior utility analyst with PaineWebber. ''Regulators and utility officials have to come back frequently and correct problems they never expected until the system gets it right.''\nSeeing an Example In Pennsylvania\nSo far, 24 states have tried some form of deregulation, but regulators and utilities in other regions say changes in their local electricity industry are inevitable, too.\nAmong states where deregulation has occurred, Pennsylvania has emerged so far as the place where the promises of competition and lower prices are being met most successfully. The state began to draw up a deregulation blueprint in 1996, around the same time California did, driven by electric rates in Philadelphia and other major cities double the average in the United States.\nBut Pennsylvania opted for a plan that calls for substantial government involvement in the market at every step. The state protected the utilities against losses from their older plants; in return utilities had to agree to freeze rates until 2006 at 1997 levels to protect consumers.\nThe state aggressively advertised a choice of new electricity providers. More important, it set the benchmark generation rates for traditional utilities at a fairly high level, which made some outside competitors' prices look favorable in comparison and which spurred consumers to choose new power providers.\nAs a result, more than 528,000 residential and business users, about 10 percent of the total, have switched to other providers that sell them power at a fixed price over long periods. A recent study by the State of Pennsylvania estimated that consumers have saved about $2.84 billion in energy costs over the last three years.\nAs consumers sought new power providers, those same companies began to build new plants in and near Pennsylvania, shoring up electricity reliability in the area. About 19,000 megawatts of power, adding 50 percent more capacity, are expected to come on line in Pennsylvania in the next five years.\nPennsylvania also cobbled together the independent system operator PJM from a network of neighboring states that could transmit power easily to one another, creating a grid third in size behind the entire transmission systems of France and of Japan.\nTrying Rate Caps In California\nYet the lurching progress of deregulation in the country as a whole and the loss of old certainties like reliable power at steady prices have ignited a popular backlash in many areas, most vividly in California. There, the state has decided to cap rates in San Diego at 1999 levels for the next two years. Other Californians have urged a rollback of deregulation, demanding that power plants sold to private owners be placed under government control again.\nThe widespread short supply of electricity and the peculiarities of the commodity itself have given generation companies enormous leverage in the marketplace. Unlike most other goods, electricity cannot be stored to be used when there is a shortage. Nor is it something consumers can do without, which means the companies that supply people with electricity will pay just about any price to keep the lights on.\nMost analysts say that the exercise of such influence is not illegal -- nor unexpected -- since companies can be expected to try to maximize their profits. But California's complex power buying mechanism has created a situation in which relatively small players have extraordinary influence.\nOn June 14, for example, the temperature in San Francisco hit 103 degrees and heat records were broken all over the Bay Area. The state's Independent System Operator, which coordinates transmission of electricity, predicted that during peak use on that weekday afternoon, California would need 43,000 megawatts. But reports from the power plants working that day showed only 36,000 megawatts available. As a result, the California I.S.O. paid $1,500 a megawatt to various plants that were not running; some of those plants had bet on a shortage and delayed generation until the price of power reached the cap.\n''The world knows we'll make up that energy shortfall somewhere,'' said Spence Gerber, director of settlements at the I.S.O. ''People go in and make their bids knowing we're not going to shut the lights off. We have no choice.''\nIn California, rate freezes have prevented most utilities from passing on much of the higher price of power to consumers. In San Diego, however, the rate freezes were lifted just as the city strained under a heat wave. That led to the doubling of customers' bills in the span of a month.\nOne part of any long-term solution, experts say, is to increase the supply of electricity, through building new power plants and transmission lines. But few communities want power plants or transmission towers on their turf, adding to delays.\nSo far, states have relied on caps on the wholesale price of power to keep costs down. In California, the price cap, until recently, was $750 a megawatt, and in Pennsylvania, it is $1,000. But California officials concede that power plants sometimes get $1,500 a megawatt-hour -- $750 for being on standby and $750 for the power itself.\nCaps, if set too low, may dissuade companies from producing electricity and from building new power plants. ''If you fix caps at $250, you have to realize that if in a neighboring state someone is offering $251 for power, you will have a serious shortage,'' said Richard Priory, chairman of Duke Energy, a nationwide power generation and trading company.\nGiven the complexities, deregulation, with its connotation of a laissez-faire management of an industry, seems a misnomer. The focus is now on reorganizing the electricity industry, rather than cutting it loose, and of using sophisticated forms of regulation to foster competition and efficiency.\n''What we're looking at is re-regulation, regulation in a different manner than we had before,'' said Douglas Hale, senior economist with the Energy Information Administration in Washington. ''Electricity is not one of those commodities that you can walk away from and let take care of itself. You need a central authority to make sure it doesn't all come crashing down.''\nIn Wisconsin, rather than having the legislature adopt an overall plan, the central state authority has moved to revamp the transmission sector before tackling generation, the reverse of what most other states have done. The Midwest price spikes in 1998 revealed that while neighboring states were willing to provide power, there were not enough transmission lines in Wisconsin to bring it in. As a result, the Wisconsin government has compelled the state's four major utilities to surrender operation of their transmission lines to the Midwest Independent System Operator, which covers several states, to make sure all companies have equal access to power lines.\n''The problem with the big bang in an industry like ours is that you take a large risk,'' said Larry Salustro, senior vice president of Wisconsin Electric. ''Maybe in three years, the market will be better. But in those three years, people will go through difficult personal and financial times.''\nThe transmission company will be responsible for building new lines to improve the importing of power, and though they own shares in the concern, no single utility controls it. Wisconsin plans to double transmission capacity in the next four or five years, by which time the state would be ready to deregulate generation.\n''You won't have low prices unless you create an effective market structure,'' said Lee Cullen, counsel for Customers First, a Wisconsin consumer advocacy group. ''Everybody can support competition as a superior system, but we're not rushing headlong into it.''\nBuilding safeguards against the volatility deregulation brings will clearly take years, as more generation -- mostly in small natural-gas-fired power plants -- starts up, as more power lines are built to move electricity to where it is needed most and as business and consumers respond to higher prices by finding ways to conserve power and limit use during peak periods.\nSome businesses and the occasional residential customer have set up links with their utilities to respond to electricity prices in real time, by turning down lights or allowing air- conditioning to shut down briefly when a computer message informs them of price spikes. So far, however, such operations are rare.\n''Until consumers can see and respond to real-time prices, price caps will remain a necessary evil,'' Mr. Borenstein said. ''The dirty secret of restructuring is that it is replacing old forms of regulation with new ones.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "The family of a Hasidic man who was fatally shot by the police last year while wielding a hammer on a street in central Brooklyn has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit charging that the officers involved in the killing acted with excessive force.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed late Tuesday night in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, also leveled much broader accusations against the Police Department and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, claiming they erected a barricade of false statements to cover up the incident and allowed -- even encouraged -- the officers involved to speak among themselves to get their stories straight before talking with investigators.\nFrom virtually the moment that the man, Gidone Busch, who was mentally disturbed, was killed in a volley of 12 shots fired by police officers on Aug. 30, 1999, there have been competing reports of what happened that night on the streets of Borough Park.\nThe day after the shooting, Howard Safir, then the police commissioner, said that Mr. Busch, 31, was shot as he was beating a sergeant with a hammer.\nProsecutors, citing both police and civilian witnesses, have said that Mr. Busch was shot after he broke free of the police effort to contain him. He ran up a narrow stairway from his basement apartment, struck an officer with his hammer, then rushed past the police.\nThey said he stood on the sidewalk with the hammer raised over his head as officers stood around him with guns drawn and ordered him to drop the hammer. There was a distinct single shot, closely followed by a volley, and Mr. Busch fell dead, prosecutors said.\nTwo months later, a state grand jury in Brooklyn cleared the officers involved in the scuffle after finding that they had acted within the law.\nBut the Busch family's lawsuit, which was filed a day before the first anniversary of Mr. Busch's death, contends that the police acted ''recklessly, intentionally, maliciously and without justification'' when they opened fire.\nMr. Busch, the lawsuit maintains, never threatened or tried to hurt a police officer or anyone else.\nFurthermore, the lawsuit charged that the officers were ''permitted, if not encouraged, to converse and consult among themselves'' to cover up the truth.\nIt also accused the city and the Police Department of failing to eradicate a ''code of silence'' among the police that was so deeply ingrained it constituted ''the actual custom, practice and policy of the City of New York.''\nMichael Anton, a spokesman for the mayor, declined to comment on the lawsuit last night.\nSgt.

Neither of the killings in which he was a suspect involved robbery or any other known motive, the authorities said.\n''By all accounts, even his family's, he was a rather disturbed individual,'' said Thomas V. Manahan, the Union County prosecutor, who spoke to reporters about the shooting at a news conference in Elizabeth, N.J. ''Mr. Perry used to carry his weapon with him at all times, and refer to it as his 'baby.' ''\nMr. Manahan also said Mr. Perry's mother told investigators he was depressed over his lack of money.\nSeveral days before the candy store shooting, the sheriff's office in Loudoun County, Va., had received a tip that the suspect in the shooting there was living with his mother in New Jersey, but they lacked sufficient evidence to arrest him, said Greg C. Brown, an investigator from the sheriff's office.\n''We didn't have enough on him,'' Mr. Brown said.\nThe raid took place just before 5 a.m. yesterday. Officials said 16 members of the Union County Emergency Response Team battered down the door of a house at 1157 Falls Terrace in Union Township, where Mr. Perry was staying with his mother, Barbara Chasten, and five other people.\nOfficers wearing bulletproof vests immediately fanned out through the house, identifying themselves as the police, with several heading up the stairs and into the three second-floor bedrooms, including one that Mr. Perry was sharing with his 8-year-old half-sister, officials said.\nMr. Perry, who had been in bed, fired a shot from his 9-millimeter handgun, hitting one of the officers' guns. The police returned fire, hitting Mr. Perry at least once in the chest, Mr. Manahan said. He said none of the officers or the girl were injured.\nThe shooting on Monday left 60-year-old Henry Dahlmeyer dead and a friend, Michael Gorka, also 60, wounded in the face. Mr. Perry entered the store and asked the owner the price of a candy bar, officials said. Officials said Mr. Perry said he did not have the money, and when the owner turned away, Mr. Perry shot the two men, then fled.\nOn the night of Sept. 15, officials said, Mr. Perry shot and killed Eric VanNederynen, 15, as the boy was walking to a supermarket near his home in Sterling, Va.

{"headline": null, "content": "WALL STREET rejoiced last month when Sanford I. Weill, the legendary deal-making chairman of Citigroup, announced that it was buying Associates First Capital, one of the nation's largest consumer finance concerns, for $31 billion. Investors bet that the deal would repeat the success of Mr. Weill's other mergers, notably Salomon Brothers and Citicorp, while bolstering Citigroup's presence in Asia, where Mr. Weill is staking a big part of his company's future.\n''It's the perfect Sandy Weill transaction,'' said Joan Solotar, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston who follows Citigroup. ''It's a business he knows, there are real cost-cutting opportunities, there's a consumer franchise in Asia and it's accretive. What more could you ask for?''\nPeople in North Carolina might say ''plenty.'' Last year, legislators there became the first to pass tough anti-predatory lending laws, taking aim at finance companies that lawmakers and consumer activists say routinely take advantage of unsophisticated homeowners. And, according to people who supported the bill, the most talked-about lender during legislative hearings was Associates.\n''The abuses by the Associates were the key catalyst for the North Carolina legislation,'' said Martin Eakes, founder of Self-Help Credit Union, a nonprofit community lender in Durham, N.C. Mr. Eakes, who piloted carts carrying VCR's through the Capitol in Raleigh so lawmakers could watch taped news broadcasts about Associates practices, questions whether Citigroup knows what it is getting into. ''It's simply unacceptable,'' he said, ''to have the largest bank in America take over the icon of predatory lending.''\nWhile the deal will give Mr. Weill the Associates' huge consumer-finance businesses in the United States and Japan -- the company has about 1,000 branches in this country alone -- those gains come with some risk to Citigroup's reputation as it marries a company that has been named in more than 700 private lawsuits, was fined $147,000 by Georgia officials earlier this year for violating state insurance regulations and is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the North Carolina attorney general. Consumer groups and some former customers have accused Associates of draining the home equity of some borrowers by deceiving or pressuring them into taking out loans and insurance policies that they did not need, might not have understood and could not afford.\nShould Democrats retake Congress next month, the ranking party members on the House and Senate banking committees promise to give priority to antipredatory lending legislation that could affect Associates' practices. Those senior legislators, Representative John J. LaFalce of Buffalo and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, sent a letter to federal banking regulators this month urging them to ''closely scrutinize this transaction in light of the disturbing allegations of predatory and discriminatory lending practices by Associates.''\nFor their part, Citigroup officials do not defend Associates' sales methods, and they say Associates employees who will be absorbed by Citigroup's consumer-finance arm after the merger will be required to adhere to strict lending guidelines.\n''We have to do whatever is necessary, because reputation is worth more than any particular quarter or any particular year's profits,'' said Charles O. Prince, Citigroup's chief administrative officer. ''I am absolutely confident we would change any practice in any part of our company to make absolutely sure that our reputation remains intact.''\nON Thursday, at a meeting in Durham, Citigroup executives listened to civil rights and community-lending leaders detail the problems they say Associates has caused for lower-income borrowers. A half-dozen homeowners told their stories personally. The group also gave Citigroup officials a laundry list of changes they wanted to see made at Associates branch offices.\nMr. Prince, the most senior official at the meeting, told the group that he understood reputational risk, noting that he recently told his daughter to go to Goodyear, and not Bridgestone/Firestone, to buy new tires. ''We don't want that same type of reaction to happen to Citigroup,'' he told the group.\nMany consumer advocates are skeptical that Citigroup will take any action that hinders Associates' profitability, and they say Citigroup officials have so far promised little in the way of improving business practices. In fact, some critics fear that Associates' lending habits will be masked by the cachet of Citigroup's franchise and its status as the nation's largest financial institution.\nBut in an interview on Friday, Mr. Prince said Citigroup was considering changing several lending practices at its consumer-loan unit, Citifinancial, which will absorb Associates' consumer lending business if the deal closes, as expected, by year-end. He declined to say what was being considered, however, and added that, ''I'm sure we will not make everybody happy.''\nWhile nothing that Citigroup is contemplating would have a material effect on its financial performance, he said, ''most all of the things we're talking about here would be new for Citifinancial as well as for Associates.'' Associates' way of doing business is ''strikingly'' different than Citigroup's, he added, in part because many of Associates' consumer loans are originated through brokers.\nAfter listening to the Associates' customers tell their stories, Mr. Prince told the group that he would investigate their cases personally. ''These were very sad cases, and there was no way to come away from yesterday's session without being deeply moved,'' he said.\nAn Associates official referred all questions about the merger and Associates' business practices to Citigroup. In the past, Associates, based in Irving, Tex., has said it has done nothing unethical and is a source of credit for many people who would otherwise be unable to borrow. While it has acknowledged misconduct by some employees, Associates has denied accusations of widespread problems, and said those accusations have been fanned by opportunistic lawyers.\nSOME community-lending advocates say they have been encouraged that Citigroup has been willing to listen to their concerns and has offered to make a few, if minor, changes.\n''I'm trying to be an optimist through this whole process, because what's at stake here is changing the modus operandi of how these big banks respond to community protests and demands for better products and services,'' said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\nMr. Taylor said he wanted to avoid the pattern of past mergers, in which banks held news conferences announcing big-dollars, but unspecific, commitments to community lending and donated money to a few activist groups. He said Citigroup last month offered a $1 million grant to his group, a Washington-based coalition representing more than 600 local and regional organizations. But he said it chose not to consider the offer until the issues surrounding the Associates merger were resolved.\nMr. Prince said that Citigroup officials did meet with coalition officials to talk about the Associates acquisition, and that there was a discussion of Citigroup paying for a financial literacy program through the organization. But he said no specific monetary offer was made.\nAccording to community-lending activists, Citigroup officials have discussed several steps with them to curb overly aggressive lending practices. These include eliminating loans with large ''balloon'' payments; starting a pilot program to have branch offices ''refer up'' customers with good credit ratings into less-expensive conventional loans; limiting prepayment penalties to the first three years of a loan; and limiting the amount of certain up-front fees to 9 percent of the loan value.\nMr. Prince confirmed that those were among the subjects under discussion, but he declined to say what else was being considered.\nYet the activists also say Citigroup officials have indicated that they are not willing to halt what critics consider to be the most serious abusive practices. Those include aggressively selling single-premium credit life insurance, a highly profitable product that a borrower pays up front for and which pays a benefit only if the borrower dies or is injured, and the repeated refinancing, or ''flipping,'' of loans, which results in new fees and other charges that often deplete homeowners' equity.\nMr. Eakes, for one, calls the proposed 9 percent limit on up-front fees shockingly high and a testament to how little Citigroup appears willing to do. ''Citigroup has stated that they would solve the problems in Associates by bringing Associates up to Citigroup's standards, but it's not totally clear that Citigroup's standards are tighter,'' he said.\nMr. Prince, referring to the assertions of flipping and credit insurance abuses, responded: ''Those two issues are key issues in this debate, and I would not feel comfortable if our business model did not in some way address those two issues.''\nEarlier this year, he added, Citifinancial began using ''mystery shoppers'' to drop in on branches to check on compliance and sales practices. That will be continued at the newly acquired Associates branches, he said. In any large sales force, he said, ''you're going to have some people who don't do the right thing.''\nOfficials at the F.T.C. and Justice Department declined to comment on the status of their investigations into Associates. Mr. Prince said that one of his first orders of business after the acquisition closed would be to meet with both agencies to ''resolve those matters pretty promptly.''\nHe said he had already blocked off time on his calendar. ''Our practice has been that it is not a smart way to run a business to be cross-wise with the government,'' he said.\nAccording to several analysts, Citigroup pursued Associates for almost a year, starting when Associates' stock slumped as more mobile-home buyers stopped repaying their loans and fewer truck drivers borrowed to update their rigs. ''They were in a number of businesses that basically blew up on them,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Mobile homes blew up clearly, unequivocally.''\nLate last year, Associates decided to pull out of mobile-home lending altogether. But by then, growth in the company's domestic consumer lending business had also stalled, leaving its foreign operations as the main source of growth. Moreover, Associates was falling behind competitors in automating its operations, a long and costly process required to make it more efficient, analysts said.\nOn Aug. 2, Mr. Hughes of Associates came to Mr. Weill's office to negotiate a takeover. They eventually agreed on a tax-free swap of stock that represented a big premium over Associates' share price but still allowed Mr. Weill to crow that it would immediately bolster Citigroup's per-share earnings.\nTalking to analysts during a conference call after the deal was announced, Mr. Weill sounded a wistful note about the origins of the financial empire that he had built over the last 15 years.\nIn 1986, Mr. Weill was hired as chief executive at the Commercial Credit Corporation, a struggling outfit in Baltimore that lent money to working people of modest means. He took that company public, and through aggressive selling and a series of ever-larger acquisitions, he created the Citigroup conglomerate that now spans consumer lending, insurance, stock brokerage and investment banking.\nLong ago, in fact, Commercial Credit's original business of lending small amounts at high rates was eclipsed by other lines of business at Citigroup. In the first nine months of this year, Citifinancial, the Citigroup unit that absorbed Commercial Credit, contributed less than 3 percent of Citigroup's $50 billion in revenue and less than 4 percent of its $9.72 billion in profit. Citifinancial has $18.5 billion in loans outstanding, or about one-tenth of Citigroup's total portfolio of loans around the world.\nThe business is neither the riskiest nor the most profitable within Citigroup. Citifinancial's borrowers default at a higher rate than do typical Citibank customers, but at a lower rate than holders of the bank's credit cards.\nCompared with Associates' strategy, Citifinancial's actually implies considerably more risk. Roughly one-half of the money lent at a typical Citifinancial branch is to borrowers who pledge no collateral, for example, while a significantly higher share of Associates' loans are secured by equity in the borrower's home or some other asset.\nBut because borrowers are more likely to default on unsecured loans, Citifinancial, by and large, can charge higher interest rates than Associates, and collect more profit: Citifinancial's annual return on its assets, or the money it lends, is about 2.5 percent, compared with about 1.8 percent at Associates. Citigroup officials have told Wall Street to expect the mix of lending at Associates branches to shift toward unsecured, higher-interest-rate loans.\nTHE most contentious point between community-lending activists and Citigroup officials appears to be the sale of single-premium credit insurance to borrowers. The premium is paid to Associates by the borrower in one lump sum that is usually added to the loan balance.\nSeveral government agencies and consumer groups have called for legislation banning single-premium credit insurance, including the Treasury Department, whose former secretary, Robert E. Rubin, is now chairman of the Citigroup executive committee. The Treasury, in a joint report on predatory lending released in June with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, called lump-sum credit life insurance ''unfair, abusive and deceptive.''\nCritics say lenders often pack the insurance into loans without telling borrowers what it does, or even that it is optional, and that it is rarely of any benefit to them. The Treasury report said these products also ''unnecessarily increase consumers' total borrowing costs, and disguise the true cost of the insurance on a monthly basis.''\nYet this insurance reaps huge profits: During the last five years, Associates' principal subsidiary, Associates Corporation of North America, has collected $1.8 billion in insurance premium revenue -- half of it from credit insurance -- and earned $397.5 million in investment income on those premiums. But it has paid out just $713.1 million in insurance benefits over that period.\nInternal Associates documents produced in court during previous lawsuits suggest that the pressure on Associates employees to sell credit insurance has been intense at times. One interoffice memo, written to group managers in 1988, instructed Associates employees to ''insist that the insurance offer is written on every application, NO EXCEPTIONS.''\nAnother internal memo, titled ''The Roadmap to Continued Record Profits in 1995,'' stated that Associates agents sold credit insurance on 57 percent of real estate loans and 61 percent of consumer loans, and it implored them to raise those levels. In the past, lawyers for Associates have said the memo circulated only in one region of the country.\nCITIGROUP officials say the problem is not with the product, but in the way that it is sold. Unlike Associates, Citifinancial discloses how much the insurance raises a customer's monthly payments and makes clear that the customer is not required to buy the insurance as a condition of getting the loan, said Robert Willumstad, Citigroup's head of consumer lending. Disclosure practices at Associates branches will be improved, he said.\nAt Associates, ''the consumer has not always understood what he or she is buying,'' he said.\n''We feel we have operated at a much higher standard,'' he added.\nAs with credit insurance, internal documents from Associates suggest that employees have been pressured to encourage homeowners and other borrowers to refinance loans; the emphasis was usually on how this would benefit the company, not on how it might help the customer. In the ''Roadmap'' memo, for example, a chart showed how the profitability of a consumer loan decreases as it ages. ''You can see how the earnings decline over time,'' the memo said. ''Your controller can provide lists to you of aged personal loans to target for renewal.''\nAnother memo, sent in 1991 to ''all branch managers,'' concerned Associates' practice of acquiring consumer loans made by other lenders or retailers. ''The principal reason we purchase an acquisition is to convert it to a more profitable loan,'' the memo stated. ''If we cannot convert acquisitions, we cannot continue to purchase them.''\nThe memo then stipulated that employees who renewed such loans, if secured by real estate, would receive a $100 bonus for each loan.\nLast month, in an investor conference call, Keith W. Hughes, the chief executive of Associates, who will join Citigroup as a vice chairman after the merger, cited the strong cultural similarities between the companies. But in an interview last week, Marge Magner, a Citigroup executive who previously oversaw Citigroup's consumer finance business, stressed what she said were big differences, particularly in how the sales staff is paid.\nAssociates bases pay on the volume of loans that employees generate, a ''count your transactions'' approach, Ms. Magner said. At Citifinancial, she said, ''we deal with the business as a whole, the whole branch and how it's growing.''\nShe also emphasized that the Citifinancial computer system used by the sales staff automatically rejected products and interest rate levels that did not seem suitable for a specific customer, giving Citifinancial a measure of centralized control over lending practices. ''A lot of the compliance issues are built into the system,'' she said.\nBill Brennan, a lawyer with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society who has testified before Congress and represented many Associates borrowers, said the changes proposed by Citigroup were not enough. ''It's crazy to say you will stop balloon abuse and maybe one or two other abuses but keep the credit life abuses and the flipping abuses and the other abuses,'' he said. ''That means the whole process is just as polluted as before. You can't just clean up part of the river.''\nIn North Carolina, some Associates practices are being investigated by Michael Easley, the attorney general, for possible violations of lending laws. Officials in Mr. Easley's office said they had become more determined after learning that some homeowners' zero-interest loans from Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit housing group, had been refinanced with high-interest loans from Associates.\nAnd Mr. Easley's office has received complaints from borrowers, including Benny and Linda Mackey of Chocowinity, about 100 miles east of Raleigh. The couple were paying $519 a month on their mortgage but had fallen behind in their payments, according to their complaint last year to Mr. Easley's office. Associates ''said the only way they could help us was to refinance it again,'' they wrote in their complaint.\nTheir monthly payment rose to $592 after Associates refinanced the $37,117.76 they already owed -- in part because a $4,231 ''loan discount'' fee and $4,910.08 in credit life insurance were added to their balance, according to documents from Mr. Easley's office. The note carried a 14.99 percent interest rate on the new principal balance of $46,541.08.\nTHE Mackeys complained of receiving harassing phone calls from the Associates after they missed some payments on the refinanced loan. They said that callers would even curse at their sons, and that they were eventually told that foreclosure proceedings had begun. But last year, three months after Mr. Easley's office received the complaint, Associates agreed to lower their interest rate to 9 percent, reducing the Mackey's monthly payment to $370, according to a letter sent by an Associates lawyer to the attorney general's office. Mr. Mackey, in an interview, said he filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors last year after he received the foreclosure notice and had not made any payments to Associates since then.\nAlan Hirsch, a deputy attorney general in North Carolina, declined to comment on the state's investigation of Associates, although he said it was not the only lender under scrutiny.\nSpeaking generally, Mr. Hirsch called single-premium credit insurance ''perhaps the most egregious practice'' by lenders. ''Many borrowers don't understand it's been included in the loan,'' he said.\nHis office has found numerous cases of borrowers whose loans were flipped, resulting in costly refinancing fees and insurance charges. In one example, he said, a borrower received $6,000 in cash through a refinancing but was charged more than $20,000 in additional financing fees and credit insurance by the lender.\n''It's legalized robbery,'' Mr. Hirsch said."},
{"headline": null, "content": "A federal appeals court has reinstated a ruling that permits student-led prayer in public-school assemblies and classrooms, after the United States Supreme Court ordered in June that the ruling be reconsidered.\nThe ruling, first issued in July 1999 and reinstated by United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit here on Thursday, allows students to initiate and lead prayer in a classroom, assembly or football game, as long as school officials do not force them to do so or participate in any way. It upheld the practice in the schools of DeKalb County, Ala., in which students led Christian prayers over the intercom and before graduations and other school events.\nThe decision angered opponents of school prayer, who believe that the lower court defied the Supreme Court. But the court and its supporters said the Constitution allowed all forms of private prayer, even those that opponents might believe the Supreme Court outlawed earlier this year.\n''Private speech endorsing religion is constitutionally protected -- even in school,'' said the decision, written by Senior Judge James C. Hill. ''Such speech is not the school's speech even though it may occur in the school. Such speech is not unconstitutionally coercive, even though it may occur before nonbeliever students.''\nThe Supreme Court had set aside the lower court's ruling in June after the high court restricted school prayer in a case involving the Santa Fe, Tex., school board. The 6-to-3 decision said that a student-led prayer before an official school event like a football game was not truly private and could not be permitted, particularly when the school selects the student to lead the prayer, provides a public-address system for the prayer and sets aside a time for the prayer.\nThe Santa Fe decision was criticized by many religious leaders and conservative organizations and has since led to a wave of Christian prayers said by students and adults in the stands at high school football games around the South.\nA week after the Santa Fe decision, the Supreme Court ordered the 11th Circuit to reconsider its Alabama ruling. It did not, however, order a completely new opinion or say that the appeals court must decide the case differently.\nIn its decision on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court said that its earlier ruling was consistent with the Santa Fe decision and did not need to be rewritten. The court, which has jurisdiction in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, said that the Santa Fe decision did not prohibit voluntary, individual prayer, and that therefore, voluntary prayer in front of others was also permitted.\nThe opinion says that the Constitution ''does not permit the state to confine religious speech to whispers or banish it to broom closets. If it did, the exercise of one's religion would not be free at all.''\nCritics of school prayer said the court had deliberately repudiated the Supreme Court's implicit desire for a new opinion.\n''When the nation's highest court vacates a ruling and says to write a new opinion according to what we are telling you is the law, you would expect the lower federal courts to take heed of that rather than defy the U.S. Supreme Court,'' said Pamela Sumners, the lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who filed the Alabama case on behalf of Michael Chandler, an assistant principal in DeKalb County who disagreed with the school prayer policy.\nBarry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said: ''The appeals court is really thumbing its nose at the Supreme Court's order. If you read these sentences literally, it really says that any student can demand to pray before or during any school event, and over the P.A. system. They act as if the Santa Fe case is a narrow, technical ruling.''\nMr. Lynn said the high court would never have set aside the Alabama decision if the court had agreed with it.\nBut Bill Pryor, the attorney general of Alabama, whose office had urged the appeals court to reinstate its ruling, said there was no reason the two rulings could not coexist.\n''This is the flip side of Santa Fe,'' Mr. Pryor said today. ''For the same reason a school cannot sponsor a prayer or religious speech, it also cannot censor a prayer or religious speech. What the court does not want to see is the use of school machinery to choose who is leading the prayer, or to set it up.''\nMr. Pryor -- a supporter of students' right to pray -- said his interpretation of the Alabama ruling was that official invocations before football games or graduations were prohibited. But schools cannot stop a valedictorian from including a prayer in a speech, he said, and they can offer a football player time to speak to the crowd in an address that may or may not include a prayer.\nThe Santa Fe decision, like many other Supreme Court opinions, contained language that could be used to support opposing positions. While it says that nothing in the Constitution prohibits voluntary student prayer, it also says that the use of a school microphone and podium gives listeners the impression that a pregame prayer is stamped with the school's approval.\n''The delivery of such a message -- over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer is not properly characterized as 'private' speech,'' the opinion said.\nNonetheless, Walter Dellinger, a constitutional scholar at Duke University Law School, said there was enough ''loose language'' in the Santa Fe decision that it could be construed as allowing the Alabama practices.\n''This is right on the edge of the Santa Fe decision,'' Mr. Dellinger said, adding that it was not particularly unusual for a lower court to reinstate a ruling that had been set aside by the Supreme Court.\nMs. Sumners said that she did not know yet what steps the A.C.L.U. would take next, but that she would not be surprised if the case was taken back to the Supreme Court for further clarification."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Don Quixote himself might have despaired at the prospect of leading America's Communist Party during the cold war, but not the indefatigable Gus Hall. Mr. Hall died last week at the age of 90. His life story, improbably enough, is a genuine American tale.\nMr. Hall was one of 10 children born to Finnish immigrants in northern Minnesota. He joined the Communist Party as a teenager and at 21 he attended the Lenin Institute in Moscow, the ultimate training ground for Communist activists.\nThe 1930's were exhilarating times for a young Communist. The Great Depression had revealed the frailties of laissez-faire capitalism, and Stalin was then leading the fight against Fascism. But the next half-century sorely tested his Communist faith. Mr. Hall's advocacy of a violent revolution earned him an eight-year stay at Leavenworth. He was in prison when Soviet troops quashed the uprising in Budapest and Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his show trials. But none of that cooled Mr. Hall's Bolshevik ardor. By 1959 he had become the party's leader -- a post he held with unswerving, often unthinking doctrinal loyalty despite the Prague Spring, the Soviet Union's economic decay and the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nMr. Hall ran for president four times. His best showing was 58,992 votes, in 1976. But he never gave up his understated Midwestern manner, even after he became a New York character and an odd kind of international celebrity. Despite his claims of independence, Soviet archives revealed that Moscow had bankrolled his activities for decades.\nMr. Hall was on the wrong side of history, and stayed there with what ultimately became a comical consistency. His favorite Soviet leader was Leonid Brezhnev. He condemned Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as ''the wrecking crew,'' and proclaimed North Korea the latest miracle to emulate. He never wavered from his sclerotic orthodoxy, and never attempted to transform the party of the proletariat into a more trendy leftist alternative. That would have offended his native Midwestern stubbornness."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Prime Minister Ehud Barak, elected on a platform of peacemaking, announced tonight that he was prepared to take an indefinite ''timeout'' from the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. That would pave the way for him to forge a national emergency government with the right-wing opposition next week.\nMr. Barak's announcement came at the end of one of the worst days of violence since the current conflict began raging three weeks ago, and on the eve of a weekend summit meeting of Arab leaders. After Palestinians confronted Israeli soldiers at checkpoints throughout the West Bank, 10 Palestinians were killed in clashes that defied the truce agreement forged early this week in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt.\nWhile it would seem obvious that the peace effort is already frozen by the violence, Mr. Barak had until recently held out hopes of returning to the negotiating table. But after saying for weeks that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was no longer a peace partner, he suggested tonight his conclusion: It is not worth Israel's time or effort to continue talking to him.\nSpecifically, an Israeli government spokesman said Mr. Barak would not send representatives to Washington in two weeks to meet Palestinian negotiators, as discussed in Egypt. This represents a blow to President Clinton, who worked hard to get the leaders to aim for a resumption of the negotiations.\nMr. Barak said he had called Mr. Clinton tonight to tell him that he thought the truce agreement was failing and to alert him to his plans. ''I have no doubt he will understand,'' Mr. Barak said.\nMr. Clinton spoke with Mr. Arafat from aboard Air Force One today, urging him in a 15-minute call to do all he could to calm the tensions.\n''He stressed the need for everyone to do what they can to restore the calm,'' said Jake Siewert, the president's press secretary. ''Arafat said he's still committed to do what he can.''\nMr. Barak gave two divergent interviews tonight on Israeli television. In one, he seemed to be saying unequivocally that he would call a timeout after the Arab League summit meeting, which begins on Saturday in Cairo. In the other, he implied that events between now and then could change his mind.\nIn delaying the start of Israel's timeout, Mr. Barak was doing several things at once. He was giving the Palestinians more time to calm violent protests. He was putting pressure on moderate Arab leaders to exert their influence on Mr. Arafat.\nAnd he was signaling to them his inclination to form an alliance with Ariel Sharon, the opposition leader of the right-wing Likud Party, unless something happened to change his mind. Arab leaders hold Mr. Sharon responsible for provoking the recent violence by his visit three weeks ago to the plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City.\n''Immediately after the summit, particularly if, as we see now, the Sharm conclusions are not preparing a quieting down, we will declare a timeout period in order to re-evaluate the situation,'' Mr. Barak said in one of the television interviews.\nPalestinians responded with anger to Mr. Barak's declaration. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official who has been suggesting for weeks that the Israeli leader was preparing an ''exit strategy from the peace process,'' said tonight that he had called it right.\n''Barak has reached a point where he is threatening the Arab leaders' meeting, linking his coming decisions to the Arab summit's decisions,'' he said on Voice of Palestine radio. ''This is a blatant threat that has never happened before.''\nMr. Erekat also accused the prime minister of ordering his troops to use excessive force today in reaction to a firefight on Thursday outside Nablus. On Thursday, a settlers' hike provoked a gun battle, during which wounded settlers lay for hours on a steep hillside waiting to be evacuated. A 64-year-old rabbi bled to death, and he was buried today. A Palestinian man was also shot dead.\n''Yesterday he sent a herd of settlers under the protection of the Israeli Army, and then Barak threatened revenge,'' Mr. Erekat said ''That's exactly what happened today. He sought revenge. My martyrs: 10 dead and 279 injured people.''\nIt is not yet clear if Mr. Sharon's Likud Party would agree to join Mr. Barak's faltering minority government. But Mr. Sharon had made it a condition that Mr. Barak take a break from the peace effort and distance himself from the concessions he was offering at the Camp David summit meeting in July.\nTwo newspaper polls published today displayed contradictory results. One showed Israel's faith in Mr. Barak at a low; another showed him rallying as a result of the crisis. But neither showed a majority of Israelis behind him. One poll found the former Likud prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, trouncing Mr. Barak if elections were held now. The other found both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Sharon handily beating him.\nWhile many world leaders -- Arab leaders aside -- have been impressed with what they see as Mr. Barak's sober approach to peacemaking and crisis, Israelis have been rough on him for most of his tenure. They have attacked him for military-style leadership, communicating rarely with his ministers and the public, and moving from policy to policy.\nNow, some hold him responsible for provoking a crisis by pushing too hard to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some Israelis were content to linger in the interim peace period, in which tensions were low and the explosive final issues were left unresolved.\nSurprisingly, the polls also showed that a majority of Israelis remain committed to the peace effort, although they feel increasingly insecure -- scared of terrorism, scared of the violence's reaching their streets, as it has in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo.\nAs Mr. Barak disclosed his inclination to suspend peace talks, helicopter gunships tonight hovered over suburban Jerusalem, joining army tanks below in an all-out assault on snipers firing into the Gilo neighborhood from a Palestinian town.\nEarlier today, Mr. Barak visited Gilo. Accompanied by Ehud Olmert, who is Jerusalem's mayor and a Likud Party leader, he inspected the tanks and concrete fortifications that the army has installed in the partly vacated neighborhood. When shots whistled through the neighborhood again tonight, Israeli tanks, in a rare use of heavy ordnance in a densely populated urban area, fired shells back at the Palestinian town.\nThroughout the West Bank and Gaza, sermons at Friday Prayer urged Muslim worshipers to protest against the continuing Israeli Army presence there. The demonstrations turned violent in Gaza and Ramallah, with protesters attacking Israeli Army posts with stones, gunfire and homemade gasoline bombs. The Israeli troops responded with tear gas and volleys of rubber-coated steel bullets.\nNear Tulkarm, in the West Bank, a busload of Israeli soldiers came under fire near a Palestinian security checkpoint. Six Israelis were seriously wounded. The shots were fired by the Palestinian police, Israeli Army spokesmen asserted. The Palestinian police there denied the charge.\nThe deaths of 10 Palestinians today raised the toll from three weeks of fighting to at least 118, 7 of them Jewish Israelis and the rest Arabs.\nAfter an American-mediated meeting on Wednesday between Israeli and Palestinian military commanders, Mr. Barak's government had said it would ''test'' Palestinian compliance with the cease-fire agreement over the next 48 hours.\nTonight, Israeli officials charged that the Palestinian Authority had failed to honor its commitments under the accord, while Palestinian officials reiterated accusations that Israel had continued to use excessive force against mostly unarmed rioters.\nIn the interview tonight, Mr. Barak was asked if he had been overly influenced by his visit today to another former Likud prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Mr. Barak issued a tight smile, and indicated that he wanted to emulate Mr. Shamir's performance during the Persian Gulf war.\n''The situation today in Israel reminds us of Shamir's situation with the Scuds exploding,'' he said. ''There were people saying: 'Attack, the Israeli army is strong. Show them.' And he didn't. We saw finally how smart Shamir was, how he wasn't dragged into things. That is how we will behave as well.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Amid growing exasperation over mounting losses at the Chrysler Group, DaimlerChrysler A.G. plans to replace Chrysler's president with a top German executive, company executives said today.\nAn announcement of the resignation of the Chrysler president, James P. Holden, is expected to come on Friday, when DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board will hold a special meeting, executives in the two headquarters in Stuttgart and Auburn Hills., Mich., confirmed. Dieter Zetsche, 47, currently head of Daimler's commercial vehicle business, will replace Mr. Holden.\nThe shake-up, first disclosed today in The Detroit News, effectively ends American leadership of Chrysler, the third biggest of Detroit's Big Three, with Daimler's German executives assuming direct control over their troubled American acquisition.\nBut analysts said that this would not in itself bring an end to the financial decline at Chrysler, because the company's troubles stem from much deeper problems in its product line and much stiffer competition in once-lucrative sport utility vehicles, minivans and light trucks.\nMr. Holden, 49, has been president and chief executive of Chrysler for only a year. But he has presided during a time of marked erosion, and last month Chrysler reported a third-quarter loss of $512 million. Since then, prospects have grown worse and many analysts now think that Chrysler will fail to match even the much-lowered estimates laid out recently by DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Jurgen E. Schrempp.\n''There is no quick fix to Chrysler's problems,'' said Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. ''What this does indicate is that they are clearly tightening the reins in Germany.''\nBy any measure, the huge-scale combination in 1998 of Daimler-Benz of Germany and Chrysler of the United States has become something of a financial disaster. Most of Chrysler's top executives have either quit or been pushed out. The list of departures includes those of Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and the onetime co-chairman of the merged company; Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's first president after the merger, and Thomas C. Gale, Chrysler's highly regarded chief designer.\nDaimlerChrysler shares traded in New York have lost more than half their value, dropping to $46.40 today from a peak of $108 in January 1999. Indeed, the market value of the combined company is now less than that of Daimler-Benz on its own.\nExecutives at the company say Mr. Schrempp was embarrassed and angered by a series of surprises at Chrysler. A day after he proclaimed that Chrysler would bounce back in the fourth quarter of this year, executives in the United States shut down seven manufacturing plants for a week to reduce inventory.\nMore significant, Chrysler overestimated the demand for its older line of minivans, which were in the process of being replaced. It found itself swamped with excess inventory and forced to offer a new round of expensive incentive programs to shore up sales of its minivans. Making matters worse, Chrysler has had to offer discounted financing even for its new line of minivans.\nAll that has sent a signal that Chrysler would have a very difficult time turning a profit or achieving Mr. Schrempp's forecast of a profit for the parent company of two billion euros -- currently $1.71 billion -- this year.\nThere is no question that Mr. Holden has been dismissed, a person close to the company said. Though Mr. Holden negotiated a financial settlement in exchange for his agreement to resign, this person said, he was given little choice in the matter.\nThe combination of plunging financial fortunes and the steady departure of American executives has demoralized people throughout Chrysler and generated a vigorous debate about whether Daimler ruined Chrysler or whether the problems were festering at the time of the merger.\nMr. Eaton, the former Chrysler chairman, who presided over the sale of his company to Daimler-Benz, has been widely reviled in the Detroit area for having sold an American icon to a German multinational. But Mr. Schrempp and other Daimler executives are themselves shellshocked by the worsening condition of their once-valued American acquisition.\nAt the time the two companies decided to merge, Chrysler was the most profitable auto manufacturer in the world. It dominated the red-hot market for sport utility vehicles, light trucks and minivans. But each of those segments has come under increasing attack, and competitors have taken away market share with newer and fresher models that made Chrysler's aging Jeeps and trucks harder and harder to sell for fat premiums. Even Japanese manufacturers, traditionally weak in light trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles, have begun to dig in.\nGregory Melich, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London, said that rather than turning a profit in the current quarter, as Mr. Schrempp had predicted just a few weeks ago, he expects the American business to lose about $20 million.\n''It is getting increasingly difficult in North America,'' Mr. Melich said, noting that General Motors was pressing ahead with costly incentive programs and that auto sales were down in October.\nMr. Holden's replacement at Chrysler, Mr. Zetsche, will have to confront severely dispirited managers and workers.\nA 19-year veteran of Daimler-Benz and DaimlerChrysler, Mr. Zetsche has spent much of his time dealing with trucks and buses. Born in Istanbul and trained in electrical engineering in Germany, he rose through a series of senior jobs and eventually became one of Mr. Schrempp's confidants. Mr. Zetsche coordinated development for commercial vehicles in the early 80's and then held a succession of senior Mercedes-Benz posts in Brazil and Argentina.\nIn 1991, he was put in charge of Daimler's American truck-making subsidiary, Freightliner. A year later, he was named chief engineer for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and then put in charge of sales at Mercedes for three years before being named head of DaimlerChrysler's commercial vehicle businesses last year.\nNone of that makes Mr. Zetsche a successor in the mold of Lee A. Iacocca or even Mr. Eaton. Industry executives say Mr. Zetsche's ties to Daimler headquarters in Stuttgart could help reduce the mistrust and improve communications between Auburn Hills and Stuttgart. But as a representative of Mr. Schrempp, he may also encounter at least covert hostility from the Americans under him."},

George W. Bush that the slow count was harming America abroad and destabilizing markets. After talking with Mr. Gore at length on Friday, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said that there should be no rush to declare a winner until all the votes are counted and recounted. It is essential, he said, that ''the people believe that this whole thing plays out in a fair way.''\nBut he disputed the widely expressed view that no matter who is declared the winner of the Nov. 7 election, the next president will be hobbled by the narrow victory, and a sharply divided Congress. ''I think the American people are pretty good about uniting behind a president,'' Mr. Clinton said.\n''I think now the country may be quite sobered by this, and the Congress may be somewhat sobered by it,'' he said. ''You might well find that there is a real willingness to work together.''\nMr. Clinton also said he was ''not quite sure'' about abolishing the Electoral College, repeating the argument that it gives small states a larger role in selecting the president. He then argued with that view, saying that if there were no Electoral College, candidates would most likely campaign even in states they would lose because they would be worried about the margin of their victory or loss."},

George W. Bush.\n''Let the record show it is five minutes before 5 p.m.,'' Judge Michael McDermott, the board chairman, a Republican, said as he conveyed the county's certified vote results to a courier dispatched by the Florida secretary of state. ''Does everybody agree on the time?''\nThere were chuckles in the County Administration Building, where county workers carried out the manual recount of Volusia County's vote. Mr. McDermott offered a hint of a smile. The Democrat on the three-member board, Patricia Northey, embraced Ann McFall, the other Republican. Applause broke out.\nAnd after a brief shuffle of papers, a signed receipt showed that the courier had received the county's certified results: 97,304 votes for Mr. Gore, 82,357 for George W. Bush. Both candidates gained from the recount: the initial machine tally had counted 97,063 votes for Mr. Gore, and 82,214 for Mr. Bush.\nOn Election Day, Mr. Gore had handily won this county, which is in the northeastern part of the state and includes Daytona Beach. But Democrats pressed for a recount here, and in three other Florida counties, because of what they called numerous irregularities, including a bag of ballots brought in by an election worker the day after the election.\nIn another twist, on Sunday evening, the canvassing board stumbled across 320 ballots that had been unrecorded by a voting machine at a polling station in the town of DeBary. The machine had apparently shut down early on the morning of Election Day; by the time it turned itself back on, it had effectively forgotten about the first 320 votes cast.\nToday, the handoff occurred barely four hours after a state circuit judge in Tallahassee rejected the county's bid for extra time, filed on Monday and joined by Palm Beach County and the Gore campaign. Election officials raced against the deadline, with the clock across the street ringing every 15 minutes as a reminder of their responsibility.\nShortly after 1 p.m., David Byron, spokesman for the county, announced the decision by Terry P. Lewis, the circuit court judge hearing the suit, to reject Volusia's request for an extension. The board voted unanimously to file an appeal; officials said later that the appeal was still active, even though the county met the deadline.\nSurrounded by lawyers and officials from both parties, the three board members spent the afternoon poring over the last of 184,339 ballots, inspecting reports from clerks in charge of each of the county's 172 voting precincts. They counted dozens of ballots which, for various reasons, had never been counted. At the request of officials from both parties, they dug up names of voters who had requested overseas ballots; those have to be tallied by Friday.\nRepublican monitors tonight accused the board of certifying bad numbers, pointing to 264 absentee ballots tabulated by machine last week, but not by today's hand count. Larry Halloran, a lawyer for the Republican Party, suggested caustically that perhaps those ballots were still in the election office.\nMr. McDermott said he wished the board had more time to resolve such issues. ''I am satisfied with the result we came up with today,'' he said. ''But I'm deeply dissatisfied with the way we had to come up with it.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "At his first public appearance today on behalf of the Gore campaign, David Boies, the latest big-name lawyer to join the vice president's legal team, discounted a comparison to his role as the victorious trial attorney retained by the government in the Microsoft antitrust case.\nBut in fact Mr. Boies is clearly hoping that the kind of crucial insight and strategic decision he made in the Microsoft case may yet work again in the legal battle for Florida's electoral votes.\nJustice Department lawyers battling Microsoft were crestfallen by a 1998 federal appeals court decision that seemed to most experts an across-the-board victory for the company and a potentially fatal blow to the government's suit. But once Mr. Boies had had a chance to read the decision carefully during a plane ride to visit the government's legal team in California, he saw that it bore a silver lining: an outline of what antitrust approach would prevail at trial.\n''By the time I got to San Francisco, I was convinced it was a good thing for us,'' he later recalled. ''It gave us a road map of what the court of appeals criteria would be.''\nOn the basis of that court decision, Mr. Boies went on to tailor his case, and trounced Microsoft at trial.\nNow the 59-year-old Mr. Boies (pronounced boys) is hoping that the decision issued today by a Florida circuit court judge, Terry P. Lewis, has likewise provided a road map. While the decision upheld Secretary of State Katherine Harris's discretion to enforce a deadline of 5 p.m. today for all Florida counties to have their ballot tallies turned in, it also said the discretion could not be exercised arbitrarily. ''The court on Page 6 of the opinion goes through and identifies the kinds of considerations that the secretary of state has to take into account,'' Mr. Boies said at a news conference in Tallahassee.\nPerhaps no trial lawyer in the United States is better suited to pursue this case for the Gore campaign than Mr. Boies, who to great effect uses a photographic memory of minute details, a disarmingly persistent style of questioning and a flair for drama.\nIn addition to the Microsoft case, which is now on appeal, he has enjoyed a remarkable string of court triumphs. He successfully defended CBS in a $120 million libel suit brought by Gen. William C. Westmoreland, represented the Resolution Trust Corporation in its $1 billion settlement against Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken, defended Westinghouse in its long-running battle with the Philippines over accusations that the company had bribed Ferdinand Marcos to build a $2 billion power plant, represented Texaco in its landmark legal struggle with Pennzoil in the 1980's and was one of the lead lawyers for I.B.M. in its defense against government antitrust claims.\nMore recently he has been representing Napster in a copyright lawsuit that may set important precedents for intellectual property on the Internet. He and his partners have also been representing plaintiffs suing an international vitamin cartel.\nMr. Boies does not wear his success on his sleeve. He prefers knit ties and inexpensive blue suits, and usually wears his Timex over his shirt sleeve so he can see the time without raising his cuff.\nMr. Boies, an Illinois native and 1966 graduate of Yale Law School, began his career at Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York, where at 31 he became the youngest partner. He left in 1997 to start his own firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The Florida secretary of state announced tonight that she would comply with a state judge's order to consider results of further recounts in the disputed presidential election, but she gave the two Democratic counties that are moving ahead with, or considering, a time-consuming hand recount a deadline of 2 p.m. Wednesday to explain their reasons in writing.\nAfter eight days of deadlock, the decision by Secretary of State Katherine Harris, a Republican, propelled the situation to a critical turn. Allies of Vice President Al Gore forged ahead with the hand recounts and possible further court challenges, but aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas claimed to see the end in sight.\nAt about 7:40 p.m., Ms. Harris appeared on national television to announce that with all 67 counties reporting by the legal deadline of 5 p.m., Mr. Bush led by 300 votes, or 2,910,492 to Mr. Gore's 2,910,192 votes, pending the counting of an unknown number of overseas absentee ballots due by midnight Friday. Her action followed a midday ruling by a state judge who upheld today's deadline for all counties to certify their votes, but said that later returns could also be considered.\n''Unless I determine in the exercise of my discretion that these facts and circumstances contained within these written statements justify an amendment to today's officials returns, the state elections canvassing commission, in a manner consistent with its usual and normal practice, will certify statewide results reported to this office today,'' Ms. Harris said. [Excerpt, Page A24.]\n''Subsequently, the overseas ballots that are due by midnight Friday will also be certified and the final results of the election for president of the United States of America in the state of Florida will be announced,'' Ms. Harris said.\nBoth sides said the judge's ruling should soon settle the question of who will carry Florida's 25 electoral votes and win the White House.\nLess than an hour after Ms. Harris's announcement, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, took to the airwaves to accuse Ms. Harris of trying to cut off the count in a way ''not required by the court.'' He said it was ''just another attempt to slow this down.''\nIt was not clear just how much authority Ms. Harris has. While Ms. Harris said she was basing her position on the ruling today in the Leon County Circuit Court, Judge Terry P. Lewis said she had discretion on whether to include any recounts in the final tally. But the judge said the local election boards had the authority to decide whether a manual recount should be done.\n''There is nothing,'' Judge Lewis said, ''to prevent the county canvassing boards from filing with the secretary of state further returns after completing a manual recount. It is then up to the secretary of state, as the chief election officer, to determine whether any such corrective or supplemental returns filed after 5 p.m. today are to be ignored.''\nUp and down the state, it was a day of just this sort of confusion, from Palm Beach County, where a local election board first suspended, then resumed a hand recount, to the courtrooms and corridors of the state capital here, where Republican officials in the secretary of state's office and the Democratic attorney general clashed sharply over interpretation of Florida election law.\nBarely five minutes before the 5 o'clock deadline, the Democratic stronghold of Volusia County became the only county to complete a manual recount, one that awarded Mr. Gore a net gain of 98 votes, which was reflected in the secretary of state's official figures.\nBut election officials in another Democratic stronghold, Miami-Dade County, first conducted a sample recount of 1 percent of the precincts, then decided that a full recount was not warranted. That decision could easily dim the prospects of an ultimate Gore victory in Florida.\nAnd in yet another development in a day of uncertainty caused by conflicting legal opinions, Palm Beach officials finally agreed to begin a full recount on Wednesday.\nThe Democratic Party filed a motion in Broward County arguing that the county should be ordered to conduct a full hand count of its 588,000 ballots. The motion said the decision on Monday by the county canvassing board not to conduct such a recount was based on an erroneous opinion by Ms. Harris, who said a manual recount can only be conducted if the board finds a problem with the computer that counted the ballots.\nBefore Ms. Harris appeared tonight, both the Gore campaign and lawyers for Mr. Bush claimed vindication in the split ruling of Judge Lewis that all 67 Florida counties must submit their certified vote totals this evening. Judge Lewis also held that the secretary of state may ignore later returns ''but may not do so arbitrarily, rather, only by the proper exercise of discretion after consideration of all appropriate facts and circumstances.''\nBut both sides were banking on opposite legal strategies, with the Bush camp, which has never trailed in any statewide tally, assuming that their ally, Ms. Harris, would find ample reason to dismiss any recounts, and Gore advisers concluding that Judge Lewis's ruling left them enough room to fight on.\nMs. Harris's announcement tonight effectively upped the ante. The Bush campaign's worst nightmare is for Mr. Gore to gain a lead in any count, and it had hoped to bar recounts outright -- even going into federal court in a failed effort to win an injunction. Now, if Mr. Gore should gain an overall lead in any recount, which would occur in public and be reported instantly, Ms. Harris could have a hard time rejecting the results.\nPresumably for that reason, Mr. Bush's chief spokeswoman, Karen P. Hughes, issued a sharp warning after Ms. Harris spoke.\n''It appears we now have a deadline that may not be respected as a deadline at all,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''Several selected counties in Florida controlled by Democrats have said they may continue a manual count. Yet if they go forward after tonight's deadline, these Democratic counties are no longer recounting. They are reinventing, attempting to reinterpret the results of the election and the intentions of voters by subjective, not objective, means.''\nJenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, countered that with the counties still counting by hand, ''The outcome of this election is very much in play. We need a full, fair and accurate count to go forward, and we're hopeful the secretary of state heeds the guidance and directives of today's court decision, and does not act in an arbitrary manner.''\nOnce again, in a surreal atmosphere of dueling news conferences and conference calls, political jockeying and threats of further legal jousting, the increasingly embittered rival campaigns courted advantage in public opinion. Most of the drama was carried live on television, and as the 5 p.m. deadline approached, MSNBC carried a countdown clock as if awaiting a space launching.\n''When is it going to end; I ask you, when is it going to end?'' former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush's chief representative here, demanded this morning as he offered to drop his objections to including any hand-counted ballots and accept however many could be submitted by this evening if the Gore campaign would drop its effort to prolong the count.\nMr. Gore's chief representative, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, dismissed that, saying it was akin to ''offering you sleeves from a vest.'' Mr. Christopher insisted: ''I see a yearning in the country for the vote to be correctly counted, and I think we're going down that path.''\nIn his remarks this morning, Mr. Baker flatly rejected any notion of accepting a statewide hand recount of ballots, a possibility that some Gore partisans have floated as a potential compromise. And the Bush camp filed notice of its intent to appeal a federal judge's denial on Monday of its request for an injunction to block hand recounts.\n''It took 15 hours to count four precincts in Palm Beach County,'' Mr. Baker said. ''There are 6,000 precincts in the state of Florida. It would take an inordinate amount of time to count 6,000 precincts manually. Furthermore, we have made very clear since we've been here, our problem with the fundamentally flawed process of manual counting here, how it promotes -- how it could lead to human error or even mischief.''\nIn agreeing that the counties must file their returns by tonight, Judge Lewis said he gave ''great deference'' to Ms. Harris's interpretation of the election law. But he disagreed that she had no discretion to count votes that arrive after that time, and said the procedures outlined in the law for contesting votes had to allow for some flexibility.\n''Depending on when a request is made and then acted upon, it is easy to imagine a situation where a manual recount could be lawfully authorized, commence, but not completed within seven days of the election,'' he wrote.\nJudge Lewis said that nothing in the law compelled Ms. Harris to accept late filed returns, but he said that by announcing ''ahead of time that such returns will be ignored,'' unless ''caused by some act of God, is not the exercise of discretion; it is the abdication of that discretion.''\nIt was this language in particular that the Gore legal team, augmented today by David Boies, the top trial lawyer who served as the Justice Department's lead courtroom attorney in its antitrust suit against Microsoft, seized on as helping its effort to have additional manual recounts added to the final tally.\n''Those counts must, under this ruling, be considered by the secretary of state,'' Mr. Christopher said. ''And we certainly hope that she would conclude that lawfully counted votes would be included in any final tabulation.''\nMr. Boies added: ''This is an injunction issued by a Florida Circuit Court telling her that she can't just stand firm and say, 'I'm not going to think about this after 5 p.m.' If she violates that, she violates a court order.''\nBut Ms. Harris's previous statements and official opinions by the state director of the Division of Elections, L. Clayton Roberts, strongly suggest she would be disinclined to look with favor on late recounts.\nThis afternoon, Donna Blanton, a lawyer in Ms. Harris's office, said: ''The secretary will consider each situation based on the individual facts and circumstances of each situation. We don't at the moment know what those are.''\nOne Republican official close to the Bush campaign said that the campaign believed the judge's ruling will cut in its favor, because there are certain to be so much confusion and inconsistent standards in manual recounts that Ms. Harris will have ample grounds not to accept many such votes and be able to be seen as acting appropriately.\n''I believe we've won,'' this official said. ''There will be disputes within the hand recount and any discretion she exercises will benefit Gore and Bush equally.''\nThe candidates themselves stayed out of sight all day, with Mr. Gore inside his official residence in Washington. As reporters and news crews huddled in the cold outside the gates, Mrs. Gore sent out doughnuts, cookies, hot chocolate and coffee. The vice president also set up a tent outside the gate.\nMr. Bush remained in semi-seclusion at his ranch near Waco, Tex., talking to advisers by phone and conducting some state business. Senior Bush aides in Austin kept a deliberately low profile, letting all public statements come from the lawyers and officials here in an apparent effort to put some distance between Mr. Bush and the wrangling."},
{"headline": null, "content": "As a former official with the Atlanta-based Carter Center, Robert A. Pastor has monitored plenty of elections, mostly in developing countries where democracy is taking its first steps. But Mr. Pastor said he had never seen anything like what unfolded this week right here at home, where both Democratic and Republican partisans in Florida have used their elected positions to influence the counting of presidential ballots.\nIn most developing countries, Mr. Pastor said, officials quickly conclude that it is vital to separate the counting of votes from any suspicion of partisanship, and they do so by placing a respected jurist or nonpartisan commission over the process.\n''The United States is at the most primitive level,'' said Mr. Pastor, now a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. ''I mean, it's below Nicaragua and Haiti in the sense that it doesn't have a national election commission and that the composition of the Federal Election Commission is made up solely of members of the parties.''\nMr. Pastor said there were often questions in developing countries about whether ostensibly independent election officials were taking sides. ''But I can't think of a situation in a developing country like this one, where the senior election officials have come out and declared themselves as partisan,'' he said.\nIf it is not quite a dirty little secret, it is at least a rarely considered component of American politics: from local canvassing boards, like those in Palm Beach County, to the Federal Election Commission, people with a partisan stake can play a significant role in determining winners and losers.\nMost elections, of course, are not close enough to trigger recounts or raise questions about defective ballots. And when they are, it is hard to know for sure whether officials are acting out of partisanship or an earnest understanding of the law.\nBut after close contests, charges of partisanship are often hard to avoid, and perception can become reality. Those charges can become magnified in situations like the Florida standoff because a decentralized election system allows states, and even counties, to follow their own laws and regulations.\nThat has been the case in Florida, where cries of partisanship arose on Monday after Katherine Harris, the secretary of state and the co-chairwoman of Gov. George Bush's presidential campaign in Florida, used her powers to help Mr. Bush. A longtime Republican loyalist, Ms. Harris declared that the state's presidential vote would be certified at 5 p.m. Tuesday, potentially suspending the recounts that could throw the election to Vice President Al Gore.\nA state court decision handed down today heightened the Democratic pressure on the Republican official, because Ms. Harris now has the discretion to accept or reject hand-tallied recounts from several counties later this week.\nFlorida's attorney general, Robert A. Butterworth, an ambitious Democrat and the chairman of Mr. Gore's campaign in Florida, is battling Ms. Harris. As soon as Ms. Harris instructed Palm Beach County officials today to suspend their recount, Mr. Butterworth issued an advisory opinion contrary to hers.\nPartisanship has also been perceived in Sunday's 2-to-1 vote by the Palm Beach County canvassing board to conduct a full manual recount. The board's two Democrats voted in favor of a recount while a third member -- a judge appointed by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican and George W. Bush's brother -- voted to oppose it.\nBut one Democrat on that board joined the judge this morning in voting to delay the recount, and a Democrat joined a Republican in Monday's 2-to-1 vote by the Broward County canvassing board against a full manual recount.\nIn Florida, the canvassing boards, which manage recounts and certify results, are composed of a county judge, the county elections supervisor and the chairman of the county commission. All are elected.\nThose officials report results to the secretary of state, who is also elected, as are the secretaries of state in about 40 states. Those positions are often seen as steppingstones to higher office. Paradoxically, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment two years ago that will make the job an appointed post in 2002.\nOn the national level, the Federal Election Commission, which monitors campaign fund-raising and spending, must be divided between Democrats and Republicans, with the president nominating appointees who are confirmed by the Senate.\nSeveral academic authorities and public officials interviewed today said that the chaos in Florida suggested that election officials, including secretaries of state, should be appointed rather than elected.\n''They probably should not be partisan jobs,'' said Raymond E. Wolfinger, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. But, Mr. Wolfinger added, Americans like the accountability elections provide and may resist giving up control.\nSeveral authorities proposed that a standing federal commission be created to set uniform standards for voting practices and to monitor results. Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana who was a secretary of state, recalled that Indiana created a bipartisan commission to conduct recounts after a tumultuous 1984 election in one Congressional district.\nIn that race, the Democratic, Frank McCloskey, won the initial count by 72 votes only to lose his lead in a recount certified by a Republican secretary of state. The House of Representatives, with a Democratic majority, ultimately overturned that result and sat Mr. McCloskey.\nTwo years later, Mr. Bayh said, the commission worked well in overseeing recounts in both congressional and legislative races. ''You can structure a process that attempts to minimize the amount of partisanship involved,'' said Mr. Bayh, ''but ultimately you have to rely on the integrity and judgment of the people involved. You just can't get around it.''\nFormer Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a former secretary of state, said he saw little need for reform because the courts provide the ultimate recourse. ''What would you trust any more than the political system?'' Mr. Cuomo asked. ''As long as you can get to a court you don't have a problem.''\nBut judges, of course, can also wield bias, as any judge-shopping lawyer can attest. Over the last two days in Palm Beach County, five judges recused themselves from hearing arguments in a lawsuit involving the election because of potential conflicts of interest."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Democrats said today that they would tie up the Senate, if necessary, to make sure they get an equal number of seats on committees and possibly co-chairmanships, if the Senate winds up evenly divided.\nThe power-sharing arrangement would be unprecedented in Congress and would strain the bounds of bipartisanship. But Democrats maintain that a committee's ratio must reflect the makeup of the Senate, and they are willing, they said, to create gridlock to make it happen.\nWhen the new Senate returns in January, one of its first missions will be to approve a resolution laying out committee assignments and chairmen.\n''We can force deliberation on that as long as we have to,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, making a pointed reference to a filibuster.\nHis second-in-command, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said, describing the number of votes it takes to break a filibuster: ''It's fairly simple. It takes a resolution to form committees in the Congress. And, of course, it goes without saying that that is something that doesn't happen with 51 votes. You have to have 60 votes.''\nSenator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said today that he would not entertain the notion of a 50-50 split because he was confident that Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, would be re-elected. That race is so close that absentee ballots, which are being counted, will decide it.\nA Gorton victory would give Republicans 51 senators, and unchallenged control, though a a loss by Mr. Gorton would bring an even split only if Gov. George W. Bush won the presidency, leaving Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in his Connecticut seat.\nMr. Daschle said he and Mr. Lott had not discussed the possibility of an even split in detail, since the Gorton race is still in doubt. But he hoped the two could work out a solution.\n''We really have every expectation that we are going to be able to resolve this in a bipartisan, practical way,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''I feel confident he wants to find the most affable way through this.''\nSenator Gorton has a slight lead over Maria Cantwell, a Democrat. A Cantwell victory would give each party 50 seats in the Senate.\nEven an equal split would tilt to the Republicans in votes on the floor, where the vice president can break ties.\nIf Democrats win the White House, Senator Lieberman would become vice president and would have to give up his Senate seat. Connecticut's Republican governor would presumably appoint a Republican to fill that Senate seat, giving Republicans an outright majority of at least one seat.\nIf Republicans win the White House, Dick Cheney, as vice president, would fill the role of tie-breaker. So, the power-sharing arrangement is possible only if Mr. Bush is declared president and Ms. Cantwell wins the Senate race in Washington State.\nBut the fact that Republians would win tie votes with Mr. Cheney is irrelevant to Democrats, who say that committee assignments must reflect the ratio of the Senate.\n''The vice president is not a member of the Senate,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''If that membership is split 50-50, there is no recourse but to allow the committees to be split 50-50.''\n''My initial feeling is that there ought to be co-chairs,'' he added.\nA few Republicans said today that a power-sharing arrangement would be inconceivable.\n''The majority always rules,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, who could end up sharing the gavel on the Commerce Committee with Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina as the ranking Democrat. ''That's the way it always worked.''\nIn fact, there is no ''always.''\nSenate rules are silent on the organization of committees, but Senate historians and academics say there has long been a tacit understanding between senators that committees should mirror the Senate's makeup.\nThere is no real modern precedent to draw on in Congress, although there is among state legislatures. The Senate was evenly split at the beginning of the 47th Congress in 1881, and it created all sorts of turmoil. Ultimately, Republicans wooed an independent to vote with them on organizing the Senate, granting him the chairmanship of the agriculture committee and many other perks to win him over, said Don Ritchie, a Senate historian.\nThe 1953 Senate also came close. In that case, the Senate was controlled by 48 Republicans and 47 Democrats. Richard M. Nixon was vice president. One independent, Wayne Morse, wound up siding with Republicans, solidifying their power.\nDemocrats turn to state legislatures, which have dealt with split votes in countless creative ways, for precedent. In Indiana, Senator Evan Bayh, a Democrat, said, the House was forced in 1988 to divide power equally.\n''We had speakers who worked alternate days, one Republican, one Democrat,'' Mr. Bayh said. Committees were evenly split, he said.\nToday, a plaque commemorates their success. ''It ended up so much better and so much more productive than anyone had anticipated,'' he said."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Michael Wells is not frightened. His world is not unraveling and he does not feel dismay. What he is is profoundly entertained.\nThe battle over hanging chads, electoral votes, and, as Al Gore apparently sees it, the very future of the democracy, makes for much better television in Mr. Wells's eyes than, say, the Subway Series (''Never watched that'') or the life and times of Elian Gonzalez (''The outcome of this is far more important.'')\nMr. Wells found O. J. Simpson's murder trial a bit more riveting on a day-to-day basis, but the turn of events in Florida top the impeachment hearings, if barely. ''It is kind of fun, really, to watch all the finger pointing and the questions of judgment,'' said Mr. Wells, a student at the University of Pittsburgh. ''I am definitely paying attention.''\nWhile the Gore and Bush camps bicker and plot, the rest of America appears transfixed by the drama playing out on computer and television screens, and the national dialogue that has resulted from it. If several dozen interviews and myriad overheard conversations here are any indication, Americans are very much enjoying the international civics lesson that the last week has provided, and their concerns -- and there are many -- are quite disconnected from those submitted by the political parties.\nThere are, for instance, plenty of conspiracy theories, including a local one here that has Gore supporters scouring mental institutions to dragoon residents to the polls in padded trucks with the promise of free cigarettes. (Well, not quite. In Wisconsin, a Democratic worker, acting on her own, gave free cigarettes to homeless people to get them to vote.)\nAnd there is fear that the partisan bickering -- strongly reflected in polls with voters whose party alliance seems to correspond directly with their feelings about the voting process -- has cleaved the nation into two hopelessly disparate parts.\n''If this goes on too long, you wonder what it will do to the unity of the country,'' said Richard Sherwin, a biology professor.\nBut the level of political discourse taking place over lunch tables, coffee carts and taxi lines appears to be far more nuanced than most in recent years, in part, perhaps, because people do not have to search for office-appropriate language to describe what they are debating, and because it is the first time many people have deeply pondered some of the issues.\n''The good thing is that everyone has had to really learn how the process works,'' said Traci Cassilly, 36, a public defender in Louisville, Ky., who had a stopover on Monday night at the Pittsburgh airport. ''Everyone should understand how their government operates, and unless you are forced to go through something like this, you might never know.'' Ms. Cassilly's friend Karen Trevathan, 30, who is also a lawyer, added: ''Well, people should probably first understand which way an arrow points on a ballot.''\nMany people simply cannot get enough, including Hao Tang, who, as a Chinese immigrant, cannot even vote. ''I've been following it almost compulsively,'' admitted Mr. Tang, 27, a graduate student who was taking a break from his constant scanning of Internet news sites to study in a common area at the University of Pittsburgh this morning. He was eagerly awaiting the noon verdict from Florida, and planned to find a computer and log on, as he has done several times a day for a week.\n''The latest developments have been somewhat excruciating,'' Mr. Tang said. ''A lot of the international students are very concerned, even though they cannot vote.''\nOn that topic, there is some rawness. Lots of Americans apparently feel like the butt of a big, international joke that is often, by way of odd translations, perhaps not so funny. They have been reading snippets from the foreign press in their own newspapers, sitting next to Europeans on airplanes and making overseas trips. ''The papers over there were saying we are not as cool as we think we are,'' said Ms. Trevathan, on her way home from Europe.\n''Our electoral process has become a laughingstock to other countries,'' said Ian McKinley, 26, as he smoked outside the bank where he works. ''I think as a result there will always be lingering questions.'' Yet, he admits, he can't stop watching.\nNeither can Christie Robertson, a special events planner, who was decorating the William Penn Hotel downtown today with Christmas lights. ''I really do enjoy what late-night comedians are doing,'' Ms. Robertson said. ''I am drawn to the television and radio. I find it very humorous at times, when the people are petty, but I also feel pretty adamant about who I think won'' (Gov. George W. Bush).\nEven those who are most worried and least entertained by the proceedings see silver linings in it. Ms. Robertson, for instance, thinks that a microscope on the voting process will help to reform it. Others see a strong call for the overturning of the Electoral College. And a deeper national engagement in politics is perceived positively by many.\n''My daughter has become more interested in current events as a result of all this,'' Professor Sherwin said. ''It has had a positive impact on younger people.''\nOthers, however, say their fill is coming.\nLast August, Ann Hazlett was yearning for more information about both candidates before she could make a choice. Now she would like to see a lot less of both of them. ''You just wish it were over,'' said Ms. Hazlett, 71.\nThis from a woman who likes suspense. She didn't decide whom to vote for until after she was inside the voting booth, and there she stood, she said, for several minutes. ''And even though the media thinks otherwise, we all will get behind whoever it finally is.'' She voted for Mr. Bush.\nIt seems that both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush appear to have worn out their welcome with some voters, as candidates and plaintiffs, if not as eventual leaders of the free world.\n''I voted for Bush but right now I say get rid of them both,'' said Fred Claus, 36, a dentist. ''At this point, these two goofballs are wasting money and if we have to recount votes, I don't think I can stand it. Whoever gets in there is doomed by this mess.''\nThere has been much talk of how consoling this whole process has been, if only that voters now truly know that their vote does count. Some people interviewed agreed. Others, however, said that the cold reality of miscounted or simply trashed votes had actually had the opposite effect.\n''I had never voted before in my life,'' said Anthony Fitzgerald, 30, a construction worker who voted for Mr. Gore. He munched a ham sandwich during his 9:30 a.m. coffee break at the construction site of a new convention center he is helping to build. ''I took the advice of my pastor this year, who said I should because it was the only way to make my voice heard. Now I really feel like it didn't count.''\nHis co-worker, Matt Nicholson, 48, also a Gore voter, saw it differently. By his logic, numerous people who never vote can now see that as a coalition, they can have meaning. ''I have really enjoyed all this,'' Mr. Nicholson said. ''I think it is real good for the country. For the first time, minorities might pull more together because they can see that they can accomplish something.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Head fakes are common in the courtroom of Terry P. Lewis.\nThe judge, who on Monday skeptically questioned Republican lawyers as they argued that Florida's presidential-vote recount must be completed by 5 p.m. Tuesday, surprised many observers today by awarding them what appeared to be a complete victory. That is, until the details of the nine-page opinion were examined.\nJust as he has done in many other cases, said lawyers who practiced before him, the judge gave the other side -- in this case, Democratic supporters of Vice President Al Gore who wanted more time for a recount -- a reason to be happy.\nHe ruled that Florida's secretary of state, a Republican and a supporter of Gov.

Bush of Texas, cannot ''arbitrarily'' refuse to accept recount results that arrive after her hard-and-fast deadline.\nJudge Lewis, known as an ace tennis player and a successful novelist, is described by lawyers in Tallahassee as polite and unflappable, the type who never becomes visibly irritated in court and whose opinions often offer something for the losing party to grasp.\nThose have been important traits for the judge, as his job as one of only a few judges who hear civil cases in Florida's capital city has landed him in the middle of some of the state's most controversial issues.\n''If they draw lots on all those tough cases, he's the unluckiest sucker in the world,'' said Deeno Kitchen, a trial lawyer in Tallahassee.\nPerhaps his biggest ruling, before today's, was a decision that angered Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican, and conservatives in the State Legislature, by overturning a 1999 law requiring that parents of minors be notified 48 hours before their daughters have an abortion.\nIn the ruling, the judge explained, ''Not every minor comes from a Norman Rockwell family, and some minors have legitimate fears of physical and emotional abuse if their parents are consulted.''\nYet many of the judge's decisions are not as definitive, lawyers said. Not only do they say that his rulings often differ somewhat from what lawyers expected, but they also describe him as a judge very comfortable with gray areas. He is quick to give losing parties a reed in his opinions, even if that lessens the overall force of his orders.\n''He'll come down with a very strong decision, but he may be inclined to modify that decision in ways that make it less crystal clear than one side or the other prevails,'' said Ben Phipps, a tax lawyer in Tallahassee. ''Maybe that's one of the reasons they hold up'' on appeal.\nMr. Phipps had one such case last year, when he sought a ruling that Florida's rules regulating title insurance commissions were unconstitutional. At first, the judge came down strongly in favor of Mr. Phipps' clients, and against title insurers, Mr. Phipps said, but later modified his decision several times, giving the other side some concessions.\n''Terry likes to come down with a firm decision, but if the other side continues to argue at great length, he's inclined to modify it,'' Mr. Phipps said.\nJudge Lewis, who turns 49 next month, allows lawyers to explain themselves at great length, and sometimes that is not a good thing for the lawyers, some lawyers said.\n''You have to be ready to answer hard questions,'' said Ed Stafman, a lawyer in Tallahassee. ''If you try to go in with a losing issue, you can pretty much be assured you're not going to get away with it, because, even if the other side doesn't catch it, he will.''\nThe judge, Mr. Stafman added, ''is widely regarded for his judicial temperament, and he listens very carefully and is very evenhanded. You could not ask for a fairer judge.''\nIn Florida, elections of trial-court judges are nonpartisan, and several lawyers who practice before Judge Lewis said they had no idea about his political leanings. Judge Lewis, a graduate of Florida State University and its law school, served on a lower trial court until 1998, when former Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, appointed him to the circuit court.\nJudge Lewis has had some success outside the courtroom. In 1997, he published ''Conflict of Interest,'' a mystery novel about an alcoholic lawyer. In a review, Booklist, the review journal of the American Library Association, said that ''in spite of some corny dialogue and narrative, first-time novelist Lewis delivers an effective, often riveting legal thriller.''\nIn an interview with Amazon.com, the online bookseller, the judge said he got the inspiration to write a book about 10 years ago, after reading other courtroom mysteries, which he thought were not very good.\nBut he told the interviewer he had no plans to become a full-time author. ''I have a day job.'' he said."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Young lawyers from some of the nation's premier law firms are flocking to Palm Beach and other battlefield counties around Florida to play a role, however minor, in the legal battles over selecting the next president.\nBut it is a stealth assault: the lawyers' firms, which pride themselves on their willingness to provide services to Republicans and Democrats alike, are requiring the lawyers to make the trip on their own, not as the firms' representatives.\nFirms whose lawyers have taken vacation time and headed south at their own expense include the Washington offices of Holland & Knight and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. Lawyers from New York and Chicago firms have made the trip as well.\n''The historical circumstances were unique. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a part of it,'' said one associate at a major Chicago law firm who spent last weekend volunteering at the Delray Beach office of the Palm Beach Democratic Party. He did not want his name used for fear of harming his career or his firm's image.\nLaw firms, especially those that represent companies in government proceedings, take care not to appear partisan, although individuals who work there may be party activists. For example, Vernon E. Jordan, a close adviser to President Clinton, is a senior partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, where Bill Paxon, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a senior adviser, though not a lawyer.\nOf course, ostensibly neutral firms that may actually have an interest, political or otherwise, in one party's victory can enjoy the best of both worlds when the actual volunteering is the work of individual lawyers.\nHolland & Knight, a firm whose client base includes Firestone, insisted that lawyers who wanted to work in Florida, on behalf of either the Gore or the Bush campaign, go on their own to avoid the potential for conflicts of interest, said Robert L. Rhodes, the firm's deputy managing partner. ''You don't want to have lawyers doing legal work on opposite sides of a dispute,'' he said.\nCorporate lawyers assisting Vice President Al Gore's campaign said e-mail messages bounced from firm to firm over the last week seeking volunteers with both the needed legal skills and the personal means to fly to Florida on short notice.\nThe lawyers say they often made travel plans without knowing where they would stay or what they would do once they arrived.\n''I was given a number to call, of an organizer,'' the Chicago associate said. A partner at his firm, who made the trip separately, told him only that ''somebody will pick you up at the airport, you'll be taken to the offices, and you'll be given something to do.''\nWhen the associate landed in Fort Lauderdale and called the number, a minivan met him and four other lawyers and ferried them to a Democratic Party office in Delray Beach.\nThere, the out-of-state lawyers sat beside Florida counterparts to interview voters who complained that they had voted for Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, when they meant to vote for Mr. Gore, or were otherwise unhappy about the balloting last week. Then the lawyers asked the disgruntled voters to complete ready-made affidavits or to prepare their own statements, which the voters signed under the watchful eyes of notaries.\n''At any given time here, we have maybe four or five volunteer attorneys from out of state'' manning the tables, said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the Palm Beach Democratic Party. He said the Delray Beach office had collected several thousand affidavits since the election.\nAs long as the volunteer lawyers are not offering legal advice, conflicts of interest should not be an issue, Mr. Rhodes said. ''I don't think you have to be a lawyer'' to help prepare affidavits, he added.\nBut it doesn't hurt, said Geoffrey Hazard, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ''Probably they are better organized and disciplined than the college students doing the same thing,'' he said.\nAnd it would be hard to stop these lawyers from participating in what might be the case of a lifetime. ''You can't say to these kids, 'You can't behave like citizens,' '' Professor Hazard said. ''Just because they're lawyers doesn't mean they're not people.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Following is the ruling yesterday by Judge Terry P. Lewis of Leon County Circuit Court in Florida on a request to extend the deadline to report results in Florida's presidential vote:\nThis declaratory judgment action is before me on the motion of the Canvassing Board for Volusia County for a temporary injunction against the secretary of state and the Elections Canvassing Commission. By motion and agreement of the parties, the Florida Democratic Party, candidate Al Gore and the Canvassing Board of Palm Beach County have intervened as party plaintiffs, and candidate George W. Bush and elector Matt Butler have intervened as party defendants.\nThe heart of the issue raised by the motion is this: Section 102.166, Florida Statutes, contemplates that upon request a county canvassing board may authorize a manual recount of votes cast in an election. Both Volusia and Palm Beach Counties have so authorized, and are in the process of conducting, a manual recount. The boards are concerned that the manual recounts may not be completed by 5 p.m. today, Nov. 14, 2000, which is the deadline imposed upon them by Section 102.112, Florida Statutes, to certify and report the election returns to the secretary of state. This section provides that if the returns are not received by the deadline, such returns may be ignored by the secretary in her certification of results statewide.\nThe plaintiffs insist that the secretary of state must consider the certified results from Volusia and Palm Beach Counties, even if they are filed late, if they are still engaged in the manual recount of the votes. The secretary of state insists that, absent an act of God, such as a hurricane, any returns not received by the statutory deadline will not be counted in the statewide tabulations and certification of the election results. For the reasons set forth below, I find that the county canvassing boards must certify and file what election returns they have by the statutory deadline of 5 p.m. of Nov. 14, 2000, with due notification to the secretary of state of any pending manual recount, and may thereafter file supplemental or corrective returns. The secretary of state may ignore such late filed returns, but may not do so arbitrarily, rather, only by the proper exercise of discretion after consideration of all appropriate facts and circumstances.\nThe secretary of state takes the position that the law requires the county canvassing boards to certify and report the results of elections in their counties no later than 5 p.m. Nov. 14, 2000, that there are no exceptions to this mandate, and that the secretary is likewise required by law to ignore any untimely received returns unless the untimeliness is caused by a hurricane or other act of God. I give great deference to the interpretation by the secretary of the election laws, and I agree that the canvassing boards must file their returns by 5 p.m. today. I disagree, however, that the secretary is required to ignore any late filed returns absent an act of God. There are several reasons for my conclusion:\n1. A reading of the entire Election Code suggests a legislative intent to balance the desire for accuracy with the desire for finality. By concentrating on the deadline imposed by Section 102.112, Florida Statutes, the secretary has come down hard on the side of finality. This interpretation ignores, however, Section 102.166, Florida Statutes, which gives to the county canvassing boards the authority to authorize a manual recount. A request for such recount may be made within three days of the election. If a manual recount of at least three precincts and at least 1 percent of the total votes indicates an error in vote tabulation which could affect the outcome of the election, the canvassing board shall either (a) correct the error and recount the remaining precincts with the vote tabulation system, (b) request the Department of State to verify the tabulation software, or (3) manually recount all ballots. Depending on when a request is made and then acted upon, it is easy to imagine a situation where a manual recount could be lawfully authorized, commenced, but not completed within seven days of the election. The secretary of state responds that the authority to authorize a manual recount is subject to the requirement that such recount be done and the results certified no later than the deadline imposed by Section 102.112, Florida Statutes. This would mean, however, that only in sparsely populated counties could a canvassing board safely exercise what the Legislature has clearly intended to be an option where the board has a real question as to the accuracy of a vote.\n2. Section 102.166, Florida Statutes, gives any candidate, or qualified elector, the right to protest the returns of a county canvassing board by filing a sworn written protest, and that protest may be filed within five days of the election, or any time before the canvassing board certifies the results, whichever occurs later. This suggests that the canvassing board might be in a position of having to address a protest of its returns the day before, or hours before, it was to certify the results pursuant to the deadline in Section 102.112, Florida Statutes, thus making it impossible to correct any error before the deadline. It is unlikely that the Legislature would give the right to protest returns, but make it meaningless because it could not be acted upon in time.\n3. Section 102.168 provides for the contesting of an election by an unsuccessful candidate or a qualified elector, by filing a complaint in Circuit Court within 10 days after the canvassing board certifies the result of an election or within five days after the canvassing board certifies the results of an election following a protest pursuant to Section 102.166(1), Florida Statutes, whichever occurs later. This provision suggests that certifications of the results in an election might occur later than usual if there is a protest of the returns.\n4. The secretary of state acknowledges that, by consent decree with the federal government, the absentee ballots of overseas electors must be counted if received up to 10 days after the election (three days beyond the deadline imposed by Section 102.112, Florida Statutes). The county canvassing board cannot report final returns, nor can the Election Canvassing Commission determine a winner of the election until all of these overseas absentee ballots are counted. The secretary explains this anomaly by inferring a requirement to do one certification of results seven days after the election and a ''supplemental certification'' 10 days after the election. There is, however, no statutory provision that provides for such a supplemental certification. Instead, Section 102.111, Florida Statutes, which deals specifically with the duty of the Elections Canvassing Commission, requires the commission to, ''as soon as the official results are compiled from all counties, certify the returns of the election and determine and declare who has been selected for each office . . . ''\n5. As noted earlier, the secretary acknowledges that Section 102.112, Florida Statutes, uses the discretionary term ''may,'' instead of the mandatory term ''shall'' as to whether late returns are to be ignored by the secretary in certifying the results of the election. That the secretary may ignore late-filed returns necessarily means that the secretary does not have to ignore such returns. It is, as the secretary acknowledges, within her discretion.\nTo determine ahead of time that such returns will be ignored, however, unless caused by some act of God, is not the exercise of discretion. It is the abdication of that discretion. An act of God has long been considered to excuse even the most mandatory of requirements. Rather, the exercise of discretion, by its nature, contemplates a decision based upon a weighing and consideration of all attendant facts and circumstances.\nThe Florida Supreme Court has stated that ''substantial compliance'' is sufficient to comply with such mandatory filing deadlines. If the returns are received from a county at 5:05 p.m. on Nov. 14, 2000, should the results be ignored? What about 15 minutes? An hour? What if there was an electrical power outage? Some other malfunction of the transmitting equipment? More particularly related to this case, when was the request for recount made? What were the reasons given? When did the canvassing board decide to do a manual recount? What was the basis for determination that such a recount was the appropriate action? How late were the results?\nObviously, the list of scenarios is almost endless and the questions that would need to be asked in properly exercising discretion as to whether to ignore or not ignore late filed returns are numerous. The secretary may, and should, consider all of the facts and circumstances.\nThe county canvassing boards are, indeed, mandated to certify and file their returns with the secretary of state by 5 p.m. today, Nov. 14, 2000. There is nothing, however, to prevent the county canvassing boards from filing with the secretary of state further returns after completing a manual recount. It is then up to the secretary of state, as the chief election officer, to determine whether any such corrective or supplemental returns filed after 5 p.m. today are to be ignored. Just as the county canvassing boards have the authority to exercise discretion in determining whether a manual recount should be done, the secretary of state has the authority to exercise her discretion in reviewing that decision, considering all attendant facts and circumstances, and decide whether to include or to ignore the late filed returns in certifying the election results and declaring the winner.\nJust as the secretary cannot decide ahead of time what late returns should or should not be ignored, it would not be proper for me to do so by injunction. I can lawfully direct the secretary to properly exercise her discretion in making a decision on the returns, but I cannot enjoin the secretary to make a particular decision, nor can I rewrite the statute which, by its plain meaning, mandates the filing of returns by the canvassing boards by 5 p.m. on Nov. 14, 2000. I also note that although the canvassing boards cannot properly contest an election, an unsuccessful candidate, or any qualified elector, may file, pursuant to Section 102.168, Florida Statutes, a complaint in Circuit Court contesting the election results. One of the specific itemized grounds for such a challenge is the ''rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election.''\nAccordingly, it is ordered and adjudged that the secretary of state is directed to withhold determination as to whether or not to ignore late-filed returns, if any, from plaintiff canvassing boards, until due consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances consistent with the sound exercise of discretion. In all other respects, the motion for temporary injunction is denied."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Until Gao Xingjian exhibited his ink paintings at a local cultural center this spring, his working-class neighbors in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet had no idea they had an artist in their midst. He was simply the polite Chinese immigrant who lived on the 18th floor of their run-down housing project. Only after the show did he become something of a celebrity, at least to those riding the elevator with him.\nWhat his neighbors still did not know was that Mr. Gao was also a writer. Until Oct. 12, that is, when their building was invaded by reporters and television crews, Mr. Gao's face appeared on the nightly news and his name circled the world. He had won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Literature, and his neighbors were thrilled. They put up a sign in the building's drab lobby proclaiming it home to a Nobel laureate and began organizing a party to celebrate.\nElsewhere in France and beyond, however, a more common response to his selection was, who? Mr. Gao has 18 plays, 4 works of literary criticism and 5 books of fiction to his name, but his entire oeuvre has been banned on the Chinese mainland since 1985, while his best-known novel, ''Soul Mountain,'' a lyrical account of a long journey through the Chinese backlands, has so far been published only in Taiwan, Sweden, France and Australia.\nLittle wonder that Mr. Gao (whose name is pronounced gow shing-jen), a slightly built man with a wry sense of humor who looks a decade younger than his 60 years, was himself taken aback by his award (which carries a prize of just over $900,000). Since taking up exile here in 1987, he has lived off paintings, not writing.\n''My only reaction was, 'Can this be true?' '' he said, recalling the telephone call from the secretary of the Swedish Academy. ''He said: 'Yes, it's true. And you have to make a speech, with a written text, for 45 minutes.' 'That's very long,' I said. Then almost immediately the doorbell rang, and there was a crowd of journalists. Since then it has been a storm. You can't imagine. If I plug in the phone, it rings. It's like a dripping tap you can't turn off.''\nStill, the Nobel effect on his publishing career was immediate. French sales of ''Soul Mountain,'' just 6,000 in the five years preceding his Nobel Prize, have now reached 45,000. HarperCollins, which had published the book in Australia, is bringing it out in the United States next week in a translation by Mabel Lee. Foreign rights for this and his second novel, ''One Man's Bible,'' an often bitter semi-autobiographical account of China's Cultural Revolution, have been sold in several countries.\nOf more immediate concern to Mr. Gao, though, is his address to the Swedish Academy on Dec. 7, three days before the Nobel awards ceremony. ''It's very important,'' he said, ''more important than the prize itself, because I have the chance to make a speech to the entire world. I have to give a message as a writer. The title will be: 'The Raison d'Etre of Literature.' ''\nThat he has chosen not to talk about politics should please China's cultural authorities, who were angered that the country's first Nobel literature laureate should be a political exile. Yet Mr. Gao is not fleeing political controversy. Politics may have disrupted his life, but he was never an activist: his battles in China were always about literature; the ''crime'' that drove him out in 1987 was that his work reflected, not socialist realism, but Western literary freedom.\nMr. Gao's interest in Western culture dates back to his childhood in Nanjing in eastern China. His mother, a member of a Y.M.C.A. theater troupe before the Communist Revolution, was an avid reader of Western literature. ''Thanks to her, we had lots of books everywhere, translations of classics, Balzac, Zola, Steinbeck,'' Mr. Gao recalled during a recent interview in French at a friend's home in Paris. ''That's why I began to read at a very early age.''\n''I always had the dream of being a writer or painter or actor or playwright,'' he went on. ''My mother and I would do little theater pieces at home. Sometimes my father was the only audience. I wrote my first novel when I was 10. It was an adventure story. At the same time, I painted. Early on, I was doing oils, water colors, calligraphy -- all sorts of things.''\nHis mother discouraged him from entering the National Academy of Fine Arts, so instead he studied French in Beijing. And once fluent in the language, he had access to more experimental Western literature, including plays by Ionesco, Beckett, Genet and Artaud. To his astonishment, he also found that political documents banned in China were often available in French, among them Khrushchev's famous -- and secret -- denunciation of Stalin in 1956.\nChinese politics, however, posed a more direct problem. During the disastrous economic program known as the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960's, Mr. Gao's mother was sent to the countryside, where she drowned in an accident. He, too, was forced into farm labor, although by now he was also writing prolifically, albeit for himself.\n''Don't send this to a publisher or a review,'' an older writer friend warned him. ''You're too young. You don't know the dangers of writing.''\nEven research into literary form, he learned, could be a political crime. ''Every written text in China had to include a eulogy to the Communist Party,'' he remembered, ''even if you were writing children's short stories or teenage things about sadness or growing up. Everything was politicized.''\nThen, when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, fearing imprisonment, Mr. Gao destroyed everything he had written.\nMore than a decade passed before China's intellectuals dared stir anew. Mr. Gao tested the waters in 1981 with a book of essays, ''A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction,'' which set off a debate about modernism and realism. He also resumed writing plays and joined the People's Art Theater in Beijing.\n''The first play I wrote after the Cultural Revolution was 'Bus Stop,' but the theater said it was too avant-garde to put on at the time,'' he said of a play strongly evocative of Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot.'' ''So I wrote another play, 'Warning Signal,' which was presented first in 1982. It caused a polemic, but was not banned. Then 'Bus Stop' was presented in 1983, and I was attacked for spiritual pollution. I was ordered to make a public self-criticism and refused. Instead, I disappeared.''\nThe voyage through southwestern China that followed eventually provided much of the material for ''Soul Mountain,'' although he had begun the book before fleeing Beijing.\n''I said to myself, 'I have already subjected myself to self-censorship, and still I was attacked,' '' he recalled. ''So I started writing a novel just for myself without thinking of having it published.''\nFive months later he returned to Beijing. He presented a new play, ''Wild Man,'' at the People's Art Theater in 1985, but then the political mood changed again, and he could no longer be published. ''The fight against spiritual pollution was not really against me, but against reformists in the Communist Party,'' he explained. ''The writer was simply a symbol for warning others.''\nMr. Gao began thinking of leaving China. He made one trip to Europe with a group of writers in 1985, then two years later, although on the blacklist as a writer, he was allowed to travel abroad as a painter. Convinced that the situation in China would deteriorate, he settled in Paris. Then, after the killing of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he resigned from the Chinese Communist Party and obtained refugee status in France. (He acquired French citizenship in 1998.)\nHis first task as an exile was to complete ''Soul Mountain,'' which was published in Taiwan in 1990. The novel, which the Swedish Academy called ''an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside,'' is remarkable not only for its magical tales, folkloric roots and eroticism but also for its patchwork of narrative styles, from poems and monologues to ballads and conversations.\n''A writer has to find his own language,'' he said. ''But my language is not a style for me. In 'Soul Mountain' you find all genres of literary writing. It is a research into style. But it is the language that counts, the joy of plunging into a language and finding a thread. It's what I call the flow of language. You have to respect this linear journey. Even if you change the pronouns -- I, you, he -- a novel is still like a long monologue.''\nEven before ''Soul Mountain'' Mr. Gao's work had been noticed in Europe. Noel Dutrait, a French scholar, sought out Mr. Gao in Beijing in the early 1980's and began studying his plays. When ''Soul Mountain'' was completed, Mr. Dutrait and his wife, Liliane, set about translating it. Considered too long by major French publishers, it was brought out in its full 670 pages by a smaller French house, Editions L'Aube, in 1995. ''The Other Shore,'' a collection of five of his plays, was published in English last year by the Chinese University Press of Hong Kong. It is distributed in the United States by the University of Michigan Press.\nIt was an admirer from Sweden who paved the way for the Nobel Prize. Goran Malmqvist, a China expert at the University of Stockholm, had also traveled to Beijing in the mid-80's to meet Mr. Gao. As it happens, Mr. Gao could not be found, but he later sent several of his plays to Mr. Malmqvist, who translated them and had them produced in Stockholm. Only in 1987 did Mr. Gao finally meet his Swedish champion, who has continued to translate his works, including ''Soul Mountain.''\nThanks to Mr. Malmqvist, then, Swedish readers and theatergoers (as well as members of the Swedish Academy) can read Mr. Gao in their own language. And it could only have helped Mr. Gao's candidacy that Mr. Malmqvist is one of 18 academy members who make the final selection of Nobel laureates. Since Oct. 12, Mr. Gao's fortuitous connection to the academy has prompted some Swedish newspapers to raise questions about conflict of interest, although Mr. Malmqvist has indignantly waved away any suggestion of impropriety.\nMr. Gao himself seems unperturbed. He said he felt lucky to have had friends around the world willing to promote his work when he was unknown. In 1997, for instance, Chinese friends in New York arranged for his play ''Between Life and Death'' to be presented in English at the Theater of the New City and his paintings to be shown at the Schimmel Center for the Arts. But he feels even luckier to be living outside China.\n''I am not sad to be in exile,'' he said. ''It has been a renaissance for me. I have been able to live off my paintings, and I have the luxury of writing what I want. I have many friends. Writing is a solitary business, but I am not alone.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Palm Beach County election officials decided today to move forward with the mammoth task of manually recounting all 462,657 ballots cast here, a process that Democrats believe could provide them the best chance of putting Al Gore in the White House.\nSurrounded by chanting crowds as they met in an outdoor parking lot at the county's emergency operations center to accommodate the crowd, Palm Beach election officials also voted to submit the vote totals from last Sunday's machine recount to the secretary of state, Katherine Harris, by today's deadline of 5 p.m. But, more significantly, the officials on the county's canvassing board vowed to go ahead with the second countywide recount in the state, saying they would then do everything possible to persuade Ms. Harris to accept those hand-tallied results.\nThe canvassing board acted in the late afternoon after a confusing and chaotic day of colliding legal maneuvers. Earlier in the day, the election officials weighed conflicting advice from local lawyers and the state's attorney general, Robert A. Butterworth, who was also the co-chairman of Mr. Gore's Florida campaign. And they waited hours for legal rulings as a string of judges recused themselves in the voters' cases involving the county's notorious butterfly ballot, wondering aloud about the legal ramifications of their decisions.\nAt the outdoor meeting in the late afternoon, County Commissioner Carol Roberts asked about the consequences of a manual recount that Ms. Harris' office today said was ''not authorized.''\n''What happens then?'' Ms. Roberts said. ''Do we go to jail? Because I'm willing to go to jail.''\nThe remark drew loud cheers from the crowd, who carried signs that read, ''Count my vote'' and ''Why don't I count?'' One man yelled: ''Go, girl!''\nCounty Judge Charles E. Burton, the canvassing board chairman, admonished the crowd to stay quiet, threatening to resume the meeting inside, where there was little room for the hundreds of journalists and demonstrators. He said the crowd would be forced to watch it on a county-run television station. ''This is not a political rally,'' Judge Burton said.\nBefore and after the judge's warning, the crowd chanted: ''We want a re-vote! We want a re-vote!'' The Republicans in the crowd wore T-shirts that read, ''I live in Palm Beach County and I voted right.''\nBen Kuehne, a lawyer for the Democrats, was exultant over the crowd's enthusiasm. ''Today was a great day,'' Mr. Kuehne said. ''Democracy in action is sometimes loud, it is sometimes raucous. I'm very confident that this canvassing board is going to do the right thing.''\nTucker Eskew, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, again said that the hand recount was prone to human error, warning that the small squares known as chads that were to be punched out by voters would be worn by overuse. ''The machines are nonpartisan,'' he said. ''These chads have started falling on the floor by the hundreds.''\nBut Democrats said they were hopeful Ms. Harris would accept the results of the hand recount in Palm Beach County, which has a large Democratic base of blacks and Jewish retirees. ''She has the discretion to consider these votes and she cannot be arbitrary about it,'' said Ron Klein, a state senator from Boca Raton. ''We've all determined that there are some irregularities. Both Democrats and Republicans witnessed those. So what's the problem?''\nThe Democrats said they believed they could gain the most in the recount from the county's 10,361 so-called ''undervotes,'' ballots on which the counting machines indicated no choice for the presidential race. A manual recount could determine either a partial hole punched for a candidate or an indentation. The partial hole could be counted as a vote, the indentation could not.\nElections officials here conducted a hand recount of about 4,600 ballots over a 12-hour period on Saturday, and had intended to begin the full countywide recount this morning at 7. The officials took Sunday off, and used Monday to hire the 50 people, who will work in seven-hour shifts, to count every ballot by hand.\nMoments before they were scheduled to begin counting this morning, the canvassing board postponed the count. They were concerned by an advisory opinion given by L. Clayton Roberts, the director of the Division of Elections, that the planned hand count was ''not authorized'' because there was nothing wrong with the county's ballot machines. That opinion was contradicted by Mr. Butterworth, who called the recount legal.\nBecause of the conflicting legal opinions, lawyers for the three-member canvassing board, all Democrats, sought guidance from the Florida Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Ms. Harris' 5 p.m. deadline to certify the county's election results loomed, causing officials here to worry that the county's vote count, submitted today, would not reflect all the votes cast in Palm Beach County until after a complete manual recount.\n''I am frustrated because I want every single vote counted,'' said Ms. Roberts, the county commissioner. ''I think we owe that to all the residents of Palm Beach County.''\nBut to accomplish that task, the lawyers had to find a county judge willing to hear nine lawsuits filed by voters challenging the legality of the county's ''butterfly ballot,'' which they say is confusing. It was a mission that proved to be especially frustrating as judge after judge refused to accept the case.\nFour circuit judges recused themselves, in a span of just two hours, for a variety of reasons, mostly conflicts of interest.\nAs the afternoon wore on and the four judges disqualified themselves, leading lawyers and elections officials to worry that none of the 11 county circuit court judges would accept the cases. The matter eventually landed in the courtroom of Judge Jorge Labarga.\nJudge Labarga accepted the case and at 3:05 p.m., he issued a series of rulings: he permitted the canvassing board to conduct a countywide manual recount, if the board chose to do so. The judge said the county could try to submit the hand recount votes to Ms. Harris, the secretary of state.\n''If she decides to accept them, fine,'' the judge said. ''If she doesn't, then you need to talk to her about it.''\nPerhaps most important, he dissolved a restraining order that had prohibited election officials from filing their returns by 5 p.m. The judge also denied a motion by the Bush campaign to move the cases out of West Palm Beach to Tallahassee.\nDuie D. Swicegood, a 71-year-old retired electrician from Harriman, Tenn., said he had watched it all, and he summed up the day this way: ''As best as I can determine, really the only achievement that was made is the count should go forward and not be stopped so everyone can have their vote counted. I think the final decision is going to be they have to count everybody's vote.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Following is an excerpt from the statement last night by Katherine Harris, Florida's secretary of state, as recorded by The New York Times:\nAs of 5 p.m. today, the director of the division of elections reported receiving certified returns from all 67 counties as required by law. In the race for the president of the United States, these certified results from Florida's 67 counties for the top two candidates are as follows: Gov. George Bush, 2,910,492; Vice President Al Gore, 2,910,192.\nThe usual practice of the State Elections Canvassing Commission is to certify these returns as soon as the compilations are completed by the division staff. However, in three Florida counties -- Palm Beach, Miami-Dade and Broward Counties -- these counties may be contemplating amended returns based upon manual recounts not completed as of today's statutory deadline.\nWithin the past hour, the director of the division of elections faxed a memorandum to the supervisors of elections in these three Florida counties. In accordance with today's court ruling confirming my discretion in these matters, I'm requiring a written statement of the facts and circumstances that would cause these counties to believe that a change should be made before the final certification of the statewide vote. This written statement is due in our office by 2 p.m. tomorrow.\nUnless I determine, in the exercise of my discretion, that these facts and circumstances contained within these written statements justify an amendment to today's official returns, the State Elections Canvassing Commission, in a manner consistent with its usual and normal practice, will certify statewide results reported to this office today. Subsequently, the overseas ballots that are due by midnight Friday will also be certified and the final results of the election for president of the United States of America in the State of Florida will be announced. We will continue to keep you informed of the relevant developments as they occur."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Like the disputed election that produced it today, the most significant legal opinion so far in this week's recount battle was split directly down the middle, giving both campaigns a claim to a legal victory that may eventually lead to a political one.\nCall it spin or call it strategy, but lawyers for the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush said the opinion, issued today by Judge Terry P. Lewis of Leon County Circuit Court, would be the foundation for their legal maneuvers over the next few days. The judge's highly ambiguous interpretation of what might have been today's hard 5 p.m. deadline for counties to submit their vote was just substantial enough to be useful to each side, lawyers said. [Text, Page A24.]\nThat sense only deepened tonight after the statement by Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state, who released results showing Mr. Bush leading by 300 votes while saying that she would give the counties considering or planning manual recounts until 2 p.m. Wednesday to offer written justification for those recounts.\nDemocrats were not pleased by her demand but were nonetheless delighted that the judge had forced her to abandon her old deadline.\n''The veil has been lifted,'' said David Boies, who served as the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft antitrust suit and was the latest member of the Gore legal team, trying to look triumphant after receiving the ruling. ''The counties have been told to go ahead and finish the recount as fast as possible.''\nThe Gore campaign had spent a frantic hour trying to figure out whether the opinion was really in its favor, and after a high-level huddle, the lawyers decided it could work to their advantage. Another of Mr. Gore's lawyers, speaking in a telephone conference call with reporters, said the Democratic strategy would now shift out of the courts and toward the counties that are still counting votes by hand, urging them to move quickly and give Ms. Harris no reason to reject them.\nBut Barry Richard, Mr. Bush's lawyer in Tallahassee, said the opinion was exactly what the Republicans were hoping for, despite the fact that the Bush campaign had filed suit in federal court trying to block manual recounts.\nNow, Mr. Richard said, as long as the secretary of state has a reasonable justification for rejecting the hand counts -- as her office has tried to do for several days -- she can do so, and the final tabulation will soon be over.\n''They were satisfied with the ruling?'' Mr. Richard asked incredulously, after hearing the comments of the Democrats. ''Well, so are we. Now we know that her reasonable interpretation of the law will be binding.'' He left little doubt that he expected Ms. Harris to reject the hand counts and certify results that left Mr. Bush as the winner of Florida and thus of the presidency.\nThe judge's nine-page opinion said Ms. Harris could not reject the hand counts that were then going on in four largely Democratic counties simply because they came in after 5 p.m. today, as she had threatened to do on Monday. Instead, she has to have a good reason.\n''Obviously, the list of scenarios is almost endless, and the questions that would need to be asked in properly exercising discretion as to whether to ignore or not ignore late filed returns are numerous,'' Judge Lewis wrote. ''The secretary may, and should, consider all the circumstances.''\nBut the judge did not tell Ms. Harris precisely what grounds she must consider for rejection or acceptance, and her remarks last night did nothing to clarify what basis she would use for evaluating the explanations she demanded. Instead both campaigns offered their interpretations.\nFor the Democrats, the removal of the 5 p.m. deadline was enormously significant. Until the ruling, Ms. Harris -- an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Bush and his brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida -- had said the deadline ended the discussion, that she was required to reject any returns that came in more than a week after the election. She issued that statement in a highly charged political atmosphere, and her interpretation was immediately challenged in Judge Lewis's court by two Florida counties and the Gore campaign.\nBy calling an arbitrary deadline ''an abdication of discretion'' by Ms. Harris, the judge moved the question to precisely where Democrats say they want it: the arena of reasonable judgment. Once she is forced to consider each hand count on its own merits, considering how diligent the counties have been, how fast they have moved, the Democrats say she cannot possibly reject them if they were conducted in good faith without appearing to be overtly political.\n''I think that we all hope that the secretary of state will do the right thing,'' Mr. Boies said. ''Now, if the secretary of state arbitrarily refuses to accept the amended returns based on the recount, and violates what this court has ruled is her duty, which is to accept those results unless she has a good reason not to, then we may be back in court.''\nAnother Democratic lawyer called the opinion a ''psychological watershed'' for Ms. Harris. If the hand counts show a very different result from the machine results she certifies, the lawyer said, ''it will be very hard to explain that to the people of Florida and the nation.''\nThe Republicans, of course, see things differently. As Mr. Richard explained it, Ms. Harris can now use any reasonable level of discretion to justify a decision to reject the hand counts, as long as she does not reject them simply because they are late.\n''I can't predict exactly what she'll do, but based on the opinions she's already expressed, if she remains consistent with that, she will reject the manual counts,'' he said.\nAs Mr. Richard noted, Ms. Harris and her subordinates have issued several opinions rejecting the validity of hand counts, and Democrats have suggested that she did so out of political loyalty to her party and the Bush family. On Monday, her employee, L. Clayton Roberts, the director of the state elections division, sent an opinion to the Palm Beach County elections board that a manual recount could only be justified by software errors in tabulation or a mechanical breakdown.\nA similar letter was sent by Mr. Roberts to Al Cardenas, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. Under state law, the elections division is required to issue advisory opinions to political parties when they request one. The Bush campaign then used these opinions as evidence in their defense of the Gore campaign's lawsuit, which they fought alongside Ms. Harris before Judge Lewis.\nThe judge's decision, which surprised many of the lawyers in the case who said they were expecting a more definitive ruling, was based in significant part on a section of state election law that says returns must be filed by 5 p.m. of the seventh day following the election.\n''If the returns are not received by the department by the time specified, such returns may be ignored and the results on file at that time may be certified by the department,'' the law says, and most of the legal concentration has been focused on the word ''may.''\nMs. Harris said before the ruling that the discretionary nature of the word was limited to acts of God, natural disasters and the like. Judge Lewis all but ridiculed such a notion, saying that ''the exercise of discretion, by its nature, contemplates a decision based upon a weighing and consideration of all attendant facts and circumstances.'' Such facts, he said, could include the reason for the recount, the timing of the decision to recount, and the lateness of the submission to the state.\nOne of the authors of the state election law seemed to agree with the judge's interpretation.\nFormer State Senator Tom Brown, a Democrat who was chairman of the Florida Senate Committee on Ethics and Elections in 1989 when the Legislature passed the bill creating the 5 p.m. deadline, said lawmakers assumed the secretary of state would apply common sense to deciding when a recount was warranted.\n''If we are going to allow somebody to request a recount, the intent obviously is that you expect a recount to be included,'' said Mr. Brown, who is now retired and living in Tallahassee. ''That would be an extenuating circumstance.''\nRegarding the secretary of state's earlier position that the deadline must be enforced with exceptions only for acts of God, Mr. Brown said, ''I think that is ridiculous. She obviously has discretion. You don't write a law giving people the ability to request a manual recount and then say you can do the recount but then not have it counted. That is obviously an absurdity.''"},

He was working for Fox as a consultant under a 30-day contract for the election.\nMr. Moody, who on Monday said Mr. Ellis had misused his role with the channel and possibly damaged its reputation, said that Mr. Ellis had denied violating any ethical standards but that he ''recognizes that his actions could cause embarrassment to Fox News.''\nMr. Moody also noted that Mr. Ellis had ''an excellent reputation'' as a vote analyst and that Fox had hired him ''because of his ability, not his bloodline.''\nAnother senior Fox executive said Fox was deferring any decision on Mr. Ellis's status because of the possibility that it might need to respond to Congressional inquiries regarding the errors that were made on election night.\nThat night, every network first called Florida as a win for Vice President Al Gore and then as a win for Mr. Bush.\nReacting to continuing criticism of their work on election night, several networks announced they would review their election coverage procedures.\nCBS was the only network to include an outsider in its review plans, announcing a three-person panel yesterday that includes Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School of Communication, along with Kathleen Frankovic, head of the network's polling unit, and Linda Mason, a CBS News executive.\nCBS said the panel would make recommendations on how its election night procedures could be modified to increase accuracy and reliability.\nABC and CNN said they had initiated reviews of their election night practices, starting Nov. 8.

{"headline": null, "content": "Following are excerpts from letters that L. Clayton Roberts, director of the Florida Division of Elections, and Attorney General Robert A. Butterworth, sent to Judge Charles Burton, chairman of the Palm Beach County canvassing board, regarding recount procedures:\nMr. Roberts\nDear Judge Burton,\nThis is in response to your request for an opinion. . . . Essentially you ask:\n1. Would a discrepancy between the number of votes determined by tabulation system and by a manual recount of four precincts be considered an error in voting tabulation that could affect the outcome of an election within the meaning of section 102.166(5) Florida Statutes, thereby enabling the canvassing board to manually recount ballots for the entire county?\n2. May a county canvassing board do a partial certification of the vote pursuant to section 102.151, Florida Statutes, for the Nov. 7, 2000, election that excludes the votes for the candidates for the presidential elections?\nWith regard to your first question, section 102.166(5), Florida Statutes, provides that if the manual recount indicates an error in the vote tabulation which could affect the outcome of the election, the canvassing board shall: (a) correct the error and recount the remaining precincts with the vote tabulation system; (b) request the Department of State to verify the tabulation software; or (c) manually recount all ballots.\nAn error in the vote tabulation means a counting error in which the vote tabulation system fails to count properly marked marksense or properly punched punchcard ballots. Such an error could result from incorrect election parameters, or an error in the vote tabulation in reporting software of the voting system. Therefore, unless the discrepancy between the number of votes determined by the tabulation system and by the manual recount of four precincts is caused by incorrect election parameters or software errors, the county canvassing board is not authorized to manually recount ballots for the entire county, nor perform any action specified in section 102.166(5)(a) and (b), Florida Statutes.\nWith regard to your second question, the answer is yes. The county canvassing board may do a partial certification of the vote pursuant to section 102.151, Florida Statutes, for the Nov. 7, 2000, election that excludes the results of the presidential election. . . .\nMr. Butterworth\nDear Judge Burton:\nOn behalf of the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, you have asked this office's opinion as to the meaning of ''error in voting tabulation which could affect the outcome of'' an election as that phrase is used in section 102.166(5), Florida Statutes.\nI am answering your request fully mindful that just yesterday the Division of Elections rendered Division of Elections Opinion 00-11 to the Chairman of the Republican Party, interpreting the duties of a county canvassing board pursuant to section 102.166(5), Florida Statutes. Because the Division of Elections opinion is so clearly at variance with the existing Florida statutes and case law, and because of the immediate impact this erroneous opinion could have on the ongoing recount process, I am issuing this advisory opinion. . . .\nThe division's opinion is wrong in several respects. The opinion ignores the plain language of the statute which refers not to an error in the vote tabulation system but to an error in the vote tabulation. The Legislature has used the terms ''vote tabulation system'' and ''automatic tabulating equipment'' elsewhere in section 102.166, Florida Statutes, when it intended to refer to the system rather than the vote count. Yet the division, by reading ''vote tabulation'' and ''vote tabulation system'' as synonymous, blurs the distinctions that the Legislature clearly delineated in section 102.166.\nThe error in vote tabulation might be caused by a mechanical malfunction in the operation of the vote counting system, but the error might also result from the failure of a properly functioning mechanical system to discern the choices of the voters as revealed by the ballots."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Before the mostly Democratic canvassing board in this bucolic town certified the vote here in Gadsden County last Wednesday, they repaired to a sealed room and examined a load of rejected ballots. When they were done, Vice President Al Gore had 170 more votes.\nBoard members say their efforts let the will of voters be counted. But enraged Republicans say they were counting clearly illegal ballots.\n''They were resurrecting dead ballots,'' said Kenneth Sukhia, a former United States attorney and a Republican, who said he was denied entrance into the room while votes were being recounted. ''This is not the way you run an election for the leader of the free world.''\nThe recount occurred last Wednesday as part of the re-tally that was mandated across the state by the closeness of the race between Gov. George W. Bush and Mr. Gore. In most Florida counties, canvassing boards simply ran the ballots through counting machines again.\nBut in Gadsden County, the canvassing board decided to examine 2,124 ballots that had been rejected by a counting machine because more than one candidate had been chosen on each. Here, as in a handful of other counties, voters marked paper ballots with a pencil. The canvassing board did not examine the rejected ballots on election night.\nThe next day, when they sorted the rejected ballots, the canvassing board counted 188 new votes: 170 for Mr. Gore, 17 for Mr. Bush, and 1 for a local write-in candidate. They tossed the rest and declared the recount as the final tally.\nDenny Hutchinson, Gadsden County's supervisor of elections, a Democrat who is not a member of the canvassing board, said he was opposed to counting the rejected ballots because of the mess some of them were in. Many, he said, were riddled with pencil marks: cross-outs, arrows, stars, write-in candidates and multiple selections. But the canvassing board went ahead anyway. ''Ballots like this didn't have any business being counted,'' Mr. Hutchinson said.\nSome people in Gadsden County said the large number of ballots with multiple markings -- 2,124 out of 16,812 -- might be explained by an aggressive get-out-the-vote drive by Gore supporters in the days before the election. Gadsden County, a lush area once famous for its ''shade-grown'' tobacco used to wrap cigars, is one of the poorest and least educated counties in the state.\n''We had many people voting for the first time,'' said Jeanette D. Wynn of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which helped in the drive. ''A lot of people were confused.''\nMembers of the canvassing board insisted they had complied with Florida law. They said they had only counted those ballots on which the intent of the voter was absolutely clear.\nThe fact that most of the rejected ballots ended up being for Mr. Gore, they said, only reflected the overwhelmingly Democratic registration of this county, which is in the Florida Panhandle. They said they had refused to open the room where they counted the votes to the public because it would have made their jobs too difficult. Besides, they said, the room had windows, and any voter was allowed to watch from outside.\n''We were trying to determine the intent of the voters,'' said Judge Richard L. Hood, the chairman of the canvassing board and a Republican. ''As far as I was concerned, the election was fair.''\nThe chief law enforcement official in the region, State Attorney William Meggs, said the rejected ballots should not have been counted. Mr. Meggs, a Democrat whose district covers six counties in north Florida, said he had never heard of ballots being counted the way they were in Gadsden County.\n''The ballot is invalid -- that's my position,'' Mr. Meggs said in an interview. ''You don't give a vote to someone whose ballot was not counted.''\nToday the dispute was reopened, when the canvassing board agreed to a Democratic Party request to open to public view all the ''overvotes'' -- ballots on which two candidates were selected. Lawyers for the Republican Party, accusing Democrats of merely searching for more Gore votes, protested the decision.\nBob Giolito, a lawyer for the Democratic Party, said Florida law allowed the canvassing board to look at -- and possibly count -- ballots rejected by the counting machines. ''All they did was try to discern the intent of the voter,'' Mr. Giolito said. ''That is clearly within their authority.''\nAccording to Florida law, no ballot should be excluded where ''there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter.'' But the law also says that no ballot should be counted where more than one candidate is chosen.\nHeath Thompson, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the secretary of state's instructions following last Tuesday's close race were clear -- that county canvassing boards were only supposed to re-run the vote-counting machines.\n''This board not only recounted, but brought in a bunch of new ballots,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''They clearly went beyond their mandate.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "A phalanx of nervous House Republicans today accused the Bush campaign of losing the public relations war over the contested presidential election, as Congress put off its lame-duck session until next month, when it hoped to know who would be the next president.\nBack in Washington for the first time since last week's election showed the country divided nearly in two, the House and Senate were quickly consumed by the presidential stalemate. The concern prompted impromptu conferences in the Senate hallways, and all across Capitol Hill, accusations flew that the White House was being stolen.\nAt a closed-door caucus of House Republicans this morning -- before the new day of legal wrangling over Florida's ballots had taken its course -- frustrations with the Bush campaign's handling of the stalemate boiled into the open, lawmakers said.\nAbout a dozen frustrated House members accused Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his advisers of ceding the court of public opinion to the Gore campaign, they said.\n''We're losing the public relations battle,'' said Representative Sonny Callahan, a senior Republican from Alabama, who was one of those who took the microphones. ''We're not getting across our message.''\nSeveral House Republicans said in interviews later that concerns had been building in their ranks not with the Bush campaign's legal tactics, but with its failure to muster an aggressive and coordinated campaign to rally the public behind the governor's position.\n''Gore realized that this was a P.R. campaign and they went into a high speed campaign mode,'' said Representative John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who is close to the Bush campaign. ''We flat don't do it as well as they do.''\nRepresentative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana, said lawmakers were not getting needed direction from Austin, Tex.\n''How are we supposed to do the spin when we don't know their next step?'' Mr. Souder asked.\nHe said Mr. Bush's Congressional supporters were caught off guard when the Bush campaign opted to sue in federal court to block the hand count of contested Florida ballots.\nThe spirited Republican caucus and a slew of hallway news conferences were signs of the tumult and partisanship gripping Capitol Hill at the very time when the voters' verdict will make it almost impossible for the House and Senate to get anything done next year without cooperation across party lines.\nSenator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, opened the Senate by noting that it took 36 ballots in the House of Representatives to elect Thomas Jefferson president after a tied election.\n''He went on to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the country,'' Mr. Lott said. ''I just leave that for a little thought for all concerned and now worried about what the future holds.''\nBut it was worries that dominated the day. The Senate quickly gave final passage to a stopgap measure to keep the government running until early next month, unwilling to take up an array of contentious spending bills until lawmakers know which party will control the White House next year and have more leverage. The lawmakers then left town to let the presidential battle run its course.\nCertainly not all Republicans were critical of the Bush campaign. Throughout the day, many defended the governor and some accused Vice President Al Gore of trying to subvert a fair election.\n''I think the Democrats are trying to steal this election,'' said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. ''There's no doubt about it.''\n''I think the vice president has stepped over the line here,'' Mr. Gramm said.\nRepresentative Jack Kingston, a Republican of Georgia, said Democrats had lost any credibility.\n''If you have somebody who was absolutely beyond partisan reproach go to Florida and oversee the ballot counting, that would be one thing,'' Mr. Kingston said. ''But sending William Daley is about like sending Yasir Arafat to Israel to settle a land dispute with the Arabs.''\nMr. Lott said simply: ''I don't think right now there would be any good purpose served second-guessing either campaign. George W. has been keeping the right tone.''\nWilliam M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman and the former Commerce secretary, worked the other side of the aisle today to keep Democrats informed and in line.\nMr. Daley met first with House Democratic leaders and then with Senate Democrats, stopping in between to appear before television cameras and reject a proposal by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III to stop the ballot count in Florida today and accept the results.\nDemocrats took to the microphones and the Senate floor today to say there was no need to rush the vote count. Senator Evan Bayh, a former governor of Indiana, called hand counts customary and said, ''It would be an incredible irony indeed if we applied a lower standard of care in selecting the president of the United States than we did for other offices across the country.''\nSenator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, recalled the Warren Commission that reported on John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the conspiracy theories that still proliferate about Kennedy's death.\n''There was such pressure to get the job done that years later we had all sorts of questions raised,'' he said said.\nEven after a president is chosen, the effort to govern will be difficult. Republicans kept control of the House but will have one of the smallest majorities this century. The Senate could end up evenly split depending on the outcome of a race in Washington State where absentee ballots are still being counted. Senate Democrats are already demanding a power-sharing arrangement.\nSome moderates in both parties vowed to have more sway and influence next year and said that the Congressional agenda would have to be more incremental. But they admitted that the suspicions and ill will caused by the presidential standoff could harden positions and hinder efforts to reach across party lines.\n''The presidential race has the potential to cause great damage,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut.\nTo preserve some stability, the two parties in the House moved fast today in separate caucuses to keep in place Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri as minority leader as well as their leadership teams.\nThe Democrats left one position unfilled, that of their campaign committee chairman; they were hoping to persuade Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island to serve again. The caucus elections must be ratified in a formal vote by the new 107th Congress in January. The Senate is to select its leaders next month.\nThe House Republicans portrayed their ability to keep a narrow though slimmer majority as a major victory over a determined Democratic effort to regain the control of the House. Though some recounts are under way, Republicans expect to have a 221-to-212 edge in the new House, or two seats fewer than in the current Congress. The House also has two independents.\n''I just want to declare victory,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who was re-elected by his party as House majority whip. ''The House held its ground.''\nMr. Hastert, a low-key leader who took command of the House after Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned at the height of the impeachment struggle, said the results showed that he was not simply a caretaker.\n''This proves we could run this House,'' he said. ''We ran it on a very slim majority. We look forward to doing the people's business.''\nMr. Gephardt, after his own selection by Democrats, said, ''Obviously we are gratified that we made progress in this election. We picked up seats.''"},

It was a dangerous weeklong journey, but he felt he had no future in Haiti, where the Duvalier government and its secret police ruled by whim and weapon.\nHe is grateful to this land, where he went to school, prospered and opened a photography studio in this city's Little Haiti neighborhood. When he became a United States citizen last September, he filled out a voter registration application.\n''Voting is liberty, liberation,'' said Mr. Benoit, who is 50. ''This country gives you a chance to do everything you want to do.''\nExcept, in his case, vote. Mr. Benoit said he never received his voter registration card, so he sat out last Tuesday's election.\nProblems like the ones that Mr. Benoit and others experienced while trying to vote have spurred civil rights organizations to call for a Justice Department investigation into voting irregularities in Florida. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began collecting information of voting problems last weekend, planning to review it and determine whether it should be turned over to the Justice Department.\nVoting is a serious matter among many Haitian immigrants who said they came to the United States intent on finally participating in the democratic process. The pain they said they felt when dozens of people were shot or hacked to death in Haiti's first post-Duvalier elections in November 1987, makes them never want to take their right to vote for granted.\nThe confusion over last week's presidential election, and the ensuing calls for a hand recount, have gnawed at Haitian immigrants here, many of whom favored Vice President Al Gore over Gov. George W. Bush.\nLocal social service and community centers said they received complaints from Haitian-Americans who were unable to vote because their names did not appear on registration lists, some polls closed early or interpreters were not available to help them.\n''Between the elections of Florida and Haiti, there is not so much difference between the two,'' said Jean Robert Lafortune, the president of the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition. ''Even though there is participation, there is no guarantee of the concept that one man and one vote will be implemented in counting.''\nThere is, however, one big difference, other Haitians said.\n''In 1987 the army massacred people who were going to vote; people were gunned down and no one was arrested,'' said Phillip J. Brutus, a Haitian-American lawyer who was elected last Tuesday to the Florida House. ''There were no legal proceedings. They didn't have any recourse. Here, they do. Any comparison is more or less symbolic.''\nGeorge Henry Brazile, a bus driver here, said he went to two polling places and waited more than an hour until he was told he could not vote because his name was not on the list.\n''I felt so sad,'' Mr. Brazile said. ''In front of everybody she handed me my voter's registration card and my driver's license and said, 'Mr. Brazile, you cannot vote.' ''\nThe continued suspense over who won has led other immigrants to see a certain irony that this should be happening here. Only a few months ago, they recalled, the State Department and the Organization of American States were criticizing the Haitian government for the delayed and flawed final vote counts in that country's legislative elections.\n''We have to send the O.A.S. here to fix the thing,'' said Florvil Samedi, a community outreach worker at the Haitian Refugee Center.\nMr. Samedi faulted the United States as having tried to impose logistical conditions on Haiti's recent vote that he said were impossible in a country with so few resources and little experience in democracy.\n''In Haiti, we had counted the ballots by hand, and they said it was no good, that we should be counting by machine,'' he said. ''In their own country now, they have to count it by hand.''\nPlaster saints framed Fritzmond Domingue as he stood by the window of Halouba Botanica, a religious-goods store where he works with his brother selling statues, voodoo flags, candles and herbal remedies for sick souls. Last Tuesday Mr. Domingue and his relatives trooped off to go vote for the Democrats, who he said would pay attention to his homeland's problems.\n''If you vote, you have more power,'' Mr. Domingue said. ''If you don't vote, somebody will say, 'Haitians don't vote, so I won't pay attention.' If you vote, you have a big power.''\nOutside the store, a sign read ''Jobs. Love. Take Away Bad Luck.''\n''If you have bad luck or you think something is wrong with you, we got treatment for you,'' Mr. Domingue said.\nAnd Mr. Gore?\n''He doesn't need anything,'' he said.

Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, stayed the same.\nThe three-member canvassing board then met to consider whether to manually recount all of the county's 653,963 punch-card ballots; shortly after 9 p.m., the board announced that, by a 2-1 vote, it had chosen not to proceed.\nDavid Leahy, the supervisor of elections for Miami-Dade County, and Myriam Lehr, a circuit court judge, were the two members of the canvassing board who voted not to pursue a full recount. Mr. Leahy, who said he had no party affiliation, made the motion; Judge Lehr, who said she was an independent, concurred.\nBoth said they simply had not found enough evidence in the recount of the sample precincts to justify going ahead with a full recount.\n''I weighed the hand-count provision and I just felt that it's not the way we should be counting votes,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''That's why we have equipment and that's why we have recounts,'' he added, referring to the precinct sample performed today.\nMr. Leahy also said the sample hand count today suggested that the initial count last week was ''a fairly accurate vote of the presidential election of Miami-Dade County.''\nLawrence D. King, a Democratic county court judge who is chairman of the board, voted to pursue the recount.\nEach of the three precincts that were recounted today are considered heavily Democratic turf. Two are black and Hispanic neighborhoods; the other is home to an elderly Jewish population.\nIn the automated recount that all counties in the state conducted last week, Mr. Gore carried Miami-Dade County by nearly 40,000 votes.\nKendall Coffey, a lawyer representing the Gore campaign, told Reuters tonight that if the sample precincts' results were extrapolated countywide, Mr. Gore might pick up 600 votes, enough to claim the lead in Florida and win the presidency.\nThe board's decision tonight not to proceed was only the latest reversal in a day punctuated by them.\nAfter the board voted for the partial recount, for example, Roberto Martinez, a lawyer for the Republicans, sought to add three precincts to the count. After contacting Bush officials, he changed his mind, saying the campaign was not interested.\nAnd just before the recount began at 3:30 p.m., lawyers from the Republican Party said they were filing a suit to prevent the count from going forward, but at 6 p.m., they said they would not proceed.\nThe three other Florida counties that had sought manual recounts each began theirs as early as Saturday. But the Miami-Dade canvassing board did not meet to consider its recount until this morning.\nThe board voted unanimously to conduct the count after hearing arguments from lawyers for the Democrats and Republicans.\nThe Democrats, who sought the action, said a manual inspection of the ballots was needed because machine tabulations had recorded no presidential selection on more than 10,000 ballots.\nBut the Republicans said no problems were found either in the machine count on Election Night or in the state-mandated machine recount the next day. On Thursday, the county certified its vote -- 328,764 for Mr. Gore; 289,492 for Mr. Bush."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Following are excerpts from news conferences last night by Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the Bush campaign, and William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, as recorded by The New York Times:\nMs. Hughes\nThe votes in Florida have now been counted, and Governor Bush won. They've been recounted, and Governor Bush won. The counties have now certified their votes to the secretary of state, and, again, Governor Bush won. Yet it appears we now have a deadline that may not be respected as a deadline at all.\nSeveral selected counties in Florida controlled by Democrats have said they may continue a manual count. Yet if they go forward after tonight's deadline, these Democratic counties are no longer recounting. They are reinventing, attempting to reinterpret the results of the election and the intentions of voters by subjective, not objective, means. . . .\nVotes are even being counted in different ways within counties. In Miami-Dade County for example, election officials have said they will examine ballots on a case-by-case, evolving basis. This chaotic, manual count in selected counties with no uniform standards cannot produce a fair and accurate count of the votes in Florida. We reiterate the only reasonable conclusion we see to this process: as Secretary Baker said this morning, Governor Bush is willing to abide by tonight's certified count and the count of overseas absentee ballots on Friday, even though this certified count may include disputed manual recounts and would cost Governor Bush votes.\nMr. Daley\nSecretary Harris's effort to cut off the vote counting in Florida by imposing a new requirement on counties in Florida, which are still counting votes, is both unfortunate and inexplicable. We continue to believe that a full and fair and accurate count of votes by the bipartisan county of board of canvassers is the best way to determine what was the true will of the people of Florida. Every Floridian has the right to have his or her vote counted. The Bush campaign and the secretary of state in our opinion are trying to cut off that right. We don't support that.\nSecretary Harris's newfound requirement that the counties write a memorandum to be submitted to her tomorrow is not supported by the judge's ruling today that set aside the hard and fast deadline of 5 p.m. set by Secretary Harris. It is an effort -- another effort in a series of efforts to obstruct the work of these counties to count the votes of the people of Florida.\nLet me also respond to the statement by the Bush campaign. The suggestion that the vote counting by the bipartisan county of board of canvassers is somehow a partisan effort is truly unfounded. Full or partial hand counts have been completed or are under way in 11 counties, some with Republican majorities and some with Democratic majorities, and some very closely divided. This is not about politics; it is about determining the will of the people fully and accurately."},
{"headline": null, "content": "It is not like Florida had such a sterling image.\nEver since the ''Miami Vice'' days, it seems like the state has gotten one black eye after another: race riots, tourist killings, government corruption, voter fraud, devastating natural disasters, a fire-prone electric chair and, of course, the debacle over Elian Gonzalez.\nOften, the behavior that baffles the nation takes place in Miami, which northern Florida tends to view as the state's troublemaker. But with the presidential election held up by double-punched ballots, flawed vote tallies and lawsuits by people who voted for the wrong candidate elsewhere in the state, alarmed residents say Florida has now become the Miami of the country.\nIn e-mail messages, telephone calls and personal encounters, many Floridians are taking a ribbing from family members, foreigners and friends who cannot understand how the democratic process could go so awry. Even Miami natives, long used to the negative spotlight, say this is by far the worst dressing-down they have had to endure.\n''This is the election of the most powerful person in the world, and, here we are, in some ways botching it,'' said Paul George, a Miamian who is a history professor at Miami-Dade Community College. ''I got an e-mail from a friend in Spain, and the thrust of the letter is, This time, all of Florida is a banana republic.''\nIn the Florida Panhandle, residents who cross into Alabama and Georgia to shop and work say the criticism from the neighboring states has been merciless.\n''Everybody thinks we're stupid,'' said Naomi Melvin, who heads the Democratic Executive Committee in Washington County in the Panhandle. ''My husband is a doctor and I have a Ph.D. We're not stupid.''\nMuch of Florida is as stunned as the rest of the country at the turn of events since Election Day. In a state of 15 million people that includes areas as diverse as South Florida, with its huge foreign-born Hispanic population, international trade and glitz, and the Panhandle, with a large native population that grows peanuts, cotton and timber and does not find the word ''redneck'' derogatory, some residents have looked at the goings-on in Palm Beach County, Volusia County and others almost as outsiders.\n''Some people say, 'They don't know what they're doing,' but really, the issues are in Central and South Florida,'' said Earl Pettis, 66, a retired health service administrator for the State Department of Corrections who lives in Sneads, a small town in northern Florida.\nThe demographic diversity of the nation's fourth-most-populous state, in fact, helped cause the deep political rift now on display for the rest of the nation. Formerly a Democratic one-party state, Florida experienced explosive population growth in the 1980's that brought in more Republicans. Defections from white voters and redistricting, some analysts say, also contributed to a drop in total Democratic registration, which now stands at 44 percent of the total, from 56 percent in 1988.\nAlthough registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans, who account for 40 percent of the total, Florida voters tend to cross party lines. That is particularly true of rural white Democrats, who vote according to factors like familiarity with the candidate and conservative views on issues like taxes and crime. Thanks largely to them, Republicans reached a watershed in 1996 and 1998, when voters installed a Republican majority in both houses of the State Legislature and elected Jeb Bush as governor.\nFor these reasons, and a growth of independents to 16 percent of registered voters, many political analysts expected a close presidential election this year. What they did not envision were the widespread problems with confusing ballots, disqualified votes, imperfect electronic counts and other glitches that have left many voters perplexed at the flaws of their democratic system.\nLance deHaven-Smith, associate director of the Florida Institute of Government, a research center at Florida State University, said, ''Florida is a little bit more prone to this because we have a large senior population, a population that has a high percentage of foreign-born immigrants, and we have an antiquated system of voting.\n''You combine all that, and it's not surprising you'd have confusion and mistakes.''\nMany residents have said they resent the implication that they cannot figure out how to vote or how to count ballots, saying that if other parts of the country experienced the same scrutiny Florida has, they, too, would see imperfections.\nAlready the butt of relentless jokes on national television, Florida residents have sometimes been their own worst critics. Dave Barry, writing for The Miami Herald, suggested putting photographs of the candidates on ballots to make them less confusing.\n''Voters could indicate their preference by using their hole-punchers to poke the candidate of their choice in the eyeball,'' Mr. Barry wrote.\nIn a more somber tenor, the message boards of some newspapers' Web sites around the state have brimmed with outrage and finger-pointing.\n''Can the residents of Florida be more embarrassed?'' wrote a reader of The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville. ''Do we live in the Stone Age or what? If we can communicate to other countries at the touch of a button, doesn't it make sense we should be able to record a vote without all this confusion?''\nThis black eye, many agree, will take a long time to heal."},

{"headline": null, "content": "While the post-election turmoil boiled on in Florida, in other states where the vote was close, officials continued to examine vote totals, and Republicans and Democrats considered whether to seek recounts.\nNone of the states -- Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon or Wisconsin -- have enough electoral votes to swing the election, but together they could determine the winner, depending on who wins Florida's electoral votes. Recounts might also change the national popular vote, where Vice President Al Gore is narrowly ahead.\nIn New Mexico, Mr. Gore shot ahead of Gov. George W. Bush for a second time after officials in Dona Ana County said on Tuesday that they had misread the total of absentee ballots and had accidentally shortchanged Mr. Gore by 500 votes. The Dona Ana county clerk, Rita Torres, said election workers thought a handwritten notation about the absentee votes from one precinct indicated 120 for Mr. Gore, when the actual number was 620.\nImmediately after the election, Mr. Gore was leading in New Mexico by about 5,000 votes out of nearly 600,000 cast. But late Wednesday, officials discovered that 67,000 absentee and early ballots had not been counted. Then on Thursday, 257 missing ballots were found in Bernalillo County, and officials there decided to recount by hand another 379 ballots that had been rejected by electronic voting machines. Those votes tilted the state in Mr. Bush's favor, giving him a 4-vote lead.\nWith the latest results from Dona Ana County, Mr. Gore was ahead by 374 votes. Other counties continued to conduct their final canvasses.\nUnder New Mexico law, requests for recounts cannot be made until state officials certify the results on Nov. 28. Republicans have not indicated whether they will seek a recount, but lawyers for the Republican Party on Saturday asked the state police to impound absentee ballots and ballots turned in early in case of a challenge or a recount.\nIn Iowa, Mr. Gore's lead over Mr. Bush narrowed by about 1,000 votes as all of Iowa's 99 counties completed their canvasses, tabulating absentee and special ballots and double-checking their math on the rest of the votes. As of Tuesday night, Mr. Gore led Mr. Bush by 4,053 votes, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Bush picked up most of his extra votes from Sioux County, a Republican stronghold in northwest Iowa. One precinct in Orange City had inadvertently recorded the same number of votes for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. The Bush total ultimately was correct, but the Gore total was actually 895 votes lower, said the county auditor, Dennis Lange, a Republican.\nA few other counties voided several hundred ballots because voters chose more than one candidate for president.\nIowa Republicans, who have assigned a monitor for the canvasses in each county, said that after all the totals were in late Tuesday they would meet to consider whether to urge Mr. Bush to seek recounts in specific counties or statewide.\n''We'll be poring over them to see if we can find anomalies, or extreme closeness'' in the vote, said Kayne Robinson, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. ''Right now,'' Mr. Robinson said, the total votes from Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are still ''quite a ways apart.''\n''If at the end of the day,'' he continued, ''it gets closer and closer, then you'd say yes'' and recommend recounts.\nThe State Democratic Party chairman, Rob Tully, said Democrats might recommend that the Gore campaign seek recounts, depending on what the Republicans do.\nOne possible focus of a recount would be Cedar County, in eastern Iowa, where officials last week recorded the only tie in the state: 4,025 votes each for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. On Monday, after counting 9 absentee ballots and 6 ballots from people whose registration could not be verified on Election Day, Mr. Gore squeaked ahead: 4,033 to 4,031.\n''I don't believe that there's anything that would change anything during a recount,'' said Betty Ellerhoff, the Cedar County auditor. ''I think it would be a waste of time and energy for everyone, but it's the candidates' choice.''\nThe campaigns have until 5 p.m. Thursday to request recounts for those counties that finished their canvasses on Monday, and until Friday at 5 p.m. for those that finished their canvasses on Tuesday.\nIn Oregon, which had a mail-in ballot, nearly 99 percent of the votes have been counted, and Mr. Gore leads by 4,765 votes out of about 1.4 million cast. About 23,000 remain to be counted.\nIf the margin falls below one-fifth of 1 percent, about 2,800 votes, an automatic recount is required. If not, the Bush campaign may decide to seek a recount. On Monday, in a preliminary step, the Bush campaign sent a letter to the Oregon secretary of state's office asking for information on the number of people allowed to re-register and receive mail ballots right before Election Day.\nIn Wisconsin, where Mr. Gore won by 6,099 votes, Republicans have until Nov. 22 to decide whether to seek recounts, and Republican officials said on Monday that they were waiting to see what happened in Florida. They have set up a telephone hot line and have received about 1,000 complaints of voting problems, mostly in Milwaukee, including cases where identification was not checked and ballots were not secured.\nRepublican officials have referred about 30 complaints to the Milwaukee County district attorney, E. Michael McCann, who said he had verified one accusation, that a Democratic worker, acting on her own, gave cigarettes to 15 to 25 homeless men to persuade them to fill out absentee ballots.\nMr. McCann said he had found ''no evidence of massive voter fraud,'' but was continuing to investigate rumors that some students at Marquette University voted more than once. On Tuesday, the student newspaper, the Marquette Tribune, reported that in an anonymous survey, 174 students admitted voting more than once.\nThe students' actions are not likely to make much of a difference, though. Michael McGraw, a Tribune editor, said of all the multiple votes the students cast, only 25 were for Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush. The rest were for themselves, friends or relatives."},

It was not clear tonight whether the county, a densely populated area just north of Miami that runs the spectrum from wealthy to disadvantaged, would make such a request.\nA manual recount of three sample precincts on Monday representing 1 percent of the countywide vote turned up only four additional votes for Vice President Al Gore. The canvassing board, with Judge Lee casting the deciding vote, concluded that same day that the change was not sufficient to justify a hand recount of all ballots.\nThe board said then that it was relying on Ms. Harris's opinion, which said counties could not order hand recounts unless voting machines were found to be faulty.\nOn Monday, Ms. Harris set a 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline for counties to file final returns. Democrats in Broward County went to court this afternoon and won a judge's ruling that they did not have to abide by the deadline. The judge, John A. Miller, did not set any time for the county to reach a decision.\nThe issue was further complicated this afternoon when Ms. Harris herself lifted the deadline for Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, saying that they had until 2 p.m. Wednesday to offer justifications for a hand recount.\nHer ruling returns the issue to the canvassing board and it was unclear tonight how they might respond or whether they would use Judge Miller's ruling to extend the new deadline past 2 p.m.\nThe lone Republican on the canvassing board, Jane Carroll, voted against the motion to reconsider the hand count, saying that she wanted a conclusion to the election and that the more ballots are handled the less integrity the election has. Mr. Lee and Suzanne Gunzburger, the Democrats on the board, voted in favor of reconsidering a countywide recount.\nEdward Pozzuoli, chairman of the Republican Party of Broward County, took issue with both the board's vote and the judge's decision.

{"headline": null, "content": "Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sent out a pre-holiday warning yesterday to panhandlers, squeegee crews, prostitutes, noisemakers and others who he said disturb the public peace, announcing his latest crackdown on ''quality of life'' crimes in New York City, this time with a high-tech spin.\nSince he came into office nearly seven years ago, Mr. Giuliani has unveiled a series of similar law enforcement initiatives, often as the holidays neared and hordes of tourists visited the city. What distinguishes this latest campaign, according to the Giuliani administration, is the enlistment of a Police Department computer mapping system traditionally used to monitor more serious crimes like robbery, rape and murder.\nNow, complaints about everything from loud music to graffiti, public drinking, prostitution, panhandling and homelessness will be ''pin mapped'' precinct by precinct, and police supervisors will be expected to move quickly and aggressively to counter any trends, the mayor and his police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, said.\n''This will now be a major area where precinct commanders and people in the precincts are held accountable,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And it really has to be done that way because quality-of-life problems are very different depending on the part of the city you are in.''\nYesterday's City Hall news conference, which drew a standing-room only crowd to the ceremonial Blue Room, represented a return of sorts to the center stage for the mayor. This summer and fall have been dominated by the ongoing election drama and baseball. The mayor has also had to curtail his activities, at least a bit, as a result of his continuing prostate cancer treatment.\nBut the mayor was in full form yesterday, boasting about the city's much-heralded success in cutting crime and his newest plans to push the numbers even lower. He made no reference to the ongoing trial of Paris Drake, the 36-year-old man charged with randomly attacking a young woman in Midtown last November with a six-pound paving stone. But it was clear that he was trying to reassure the public that crackdowns on the homeless, as well as earlier ones related to graffiti, loud radios and other nuisance crimes, are still under way.\n''The City of New York is now world famous for its turnaround, its renaissance, its reform, whatever you want to call it,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''The core, however, of the turnaround of New York City has to do with public safety and quality of life. I would like to remind people of that.''\nWithin hours of the announcement, though, some community leaders and civil libertarians were questioning the impact the mayor's new initiative might have, other than to earn some public relations notice. Most of the nuisance crimes cited by the mayor yesterday have been the focus of special enforcement efforts before, they noted. They also raised concerns that in the zeal to impose order, the administration might compromise individual rights.\n''The real issue here is what tactics will the N.Y.P.D. employ and whether these tactics will violate people's civil liberties, as they have done before,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ''Other municipalities, such as Boston and San Diego, have dramatically reduced crime without this dark side.''\nBut the mayor defended the city's policies, particularly last year's initiative to try to remove the homeless from the streets, saying that contrary to predictions, the police arrested only a small percentage of the homeless they encountered since last November. Of the 28,671 homeless questioned by the police in the last 12 months, 6,365 were transported to shelters, 532 were taken to hospitals and another 1,317, or 4.6 percent of those questioned, were arrested on charges including outstanding warrants, urinating in public and disruptive behavior with police officers or social workers, the mayor said.\nThe mayor also took the chance yesterday to offer a few quick civics lessons as a defense of his focus on these ''quality of life'' crimes. Regarding the homeless, he said: ''You are not allowed to live on a street in a civilized city. It is not good for you; it is not good for us.'' He added: ''Maybe the city was stupid enough to embrace that idea years ago. We care about you enough and are not that dumb to think you should live on streets. So we contact and tell you, you have got to move.''\nThe mayor gave little hint of which of the many threats to civil order that he cited would get the most attention. But police officials said enforcement efforts would be based, in part, on complaints collected from the mayor's Quality of Life phone line (888-677-LIFE or 888-677-5433), which in the first eight and a half months of this year received 38,167 calls, with noise complaints by far the most frequent.\nCommissioner Kerik said that the police would not expand any squads assigned to ''quality of life'' crimes or increase spending on overtime. Instead, at weekly meetings of precinct commanders and other department officials, progress in combating nuisance crimes will be discussed and officers out on routine patrols will now be expected to pay more attention to them. Mr. Kerik said that unless there is a consistent focus on these kinds of complaints, enforcement tends to surge and then decline.\n''Prostitution particularly, graffiti, panhandling, they will disappear for a while, then when the focus and direction is off those problematic areas out on the street they start to flourish and pop back up again,'' Mr. Kerik said. ''If we stay on them constantly,'' he added, ''we will be able to keep them to a very minimal level.''\nMr. Giuliani acknowledged that the effort might result in a surge in new citations and arrests, which could ultimately increase the burden on the city's courts. But he added that that did not worry him.\n''We explained it to the court,'' he said. ''They may have to work a little harder. That is good.''"},

But now the former bakery has a second large tenant: PricewaterhouseCoopers, the national accounting and consulting firm, which signed a lease in late October for 64,000 square feet.\nThe firm plans to use the space for its rapidly growing Unifi Network division, which does outsourcing and other human resources consulting and which needs office space, as well as storage and distribution space for documents, said Jeff Croyle, a partner at Unifi.\nMr. Croyle said his company had decided to move into the 226,000-square-foot Totowa Business Center, as the property is now known, because it was near two other local Unifi offices, in Fort Lee and Little Falls, and because options for flex space -- which can serve a variety of functions -- were limited in that part of New Jersey.\nPeter L. DiCapua, a senior vice president at Atco, confirmed the high demand for high-tech flex space in the area around Totowa. ''There is less than 100,000 square feet of well-developed, high-tech flex space available in the immediate area around Totowa, and it could probably support twice as much space,'' Mr. DiCapua said.\nHe added that interest was being shown mostly by high-tech companies, medical concerns and data processing and call centers.\nRents at the Totowa Business Center are now relatively low, Mr. DiCapua said, adding that his company was asking $14 per square foot annually for office space and $8 for warehouse space, while the market rate for the Totowa area was now up to $18 for office space and $10 for warehouse space.\nHe said the Totowa Business Center had only about 55,000 square feet of space left for lease, in the form of three units, each unit measuring 180 feet by 100 feet. The available space, he said, has attracted ''quite a bit of interest'' from prospective tenants since CB Richard Ellis, the center's leasing agent, began marketing it early this year.\n''We always thought that our site was ideal for flex space,'' Mr. DiCapua said, adding that Atco's experience with this type of property had been honed with projects like revamping the old Atlas Terminals building in Queens.\nAtco, he said, initially liked the Totowa property because it was near major roads, like Route 80, and also because it was in an area that has been wired for high-speed broad-band telecommunications.\nStill, Atco waited more than a year before it began to overhaul the property. It was calculating whether to position the building as warehouse and distribution space or as flex space, suitable for office use.\n''We wanted to see what the market was really doing,'' Mr. DiCapua said. ''When we finally started work in April 1999, it was evident then that the market was demanding more office and less warehouse space.''\nTo create a large parking area that would support office users, Atco first demolished 54,000 square feet of the building that had been added during one of three earlier expansions. The property now has 863 spaces.\nDuring the renovation, which was finished in April, Atco also overhauled access to the building. Until then, the building's main entrance was on North Riverview Drive, and most of the trucks that had served it -- and its office users -- had shared the same entrance, as well as parking lot.\nAtco wanted to ensure that its new business center would have separate parking lots, as well as a more direct link to the recently built West Belt Highway, which is scheduled to open soon and will provide a more direct route to Route 23, Mr. DiCapua said.\nAs a result, he said, the company added a main entrance, as well as a separate trucking entrance, on Taft Road.\nInside, the old English muffin factory posed some particular challenges. For one, when Atco acquired it, it was filled with baking equipment like dough mixers, three of the long assembly lines and three concrete-and-steel grain silos, Mr. DiCapua said.\nBestfoods eventually removed the equipment. And Atco delved into improvements, like revamping the central heating and cooling system to allow tenants individual control. Other renovation efforts, Mr. DiCapua said, included installing hundreds of storefront windows, putting in new electrical wiring, reshaping and upgrading the building's original brick facade and ensuring that the building could accommodate broad-band technology.\nThe space occupied by Bestfoods was redesigned as well, he said, with measures like changing the existing large exterior offices into the smaller offices wanted by Bestfoods."},

{"headline": null, "content": "President Clinton today began a five-day farewell tour of Asia, arguing that the summit meeting of Asian leaders he began in 1993 has begun to weave the region together for the first time in history.\nBut Mr. Clinton, in a speech to Asian business leaders in this steamy city on the northern coast of Borneo, warned that countries backtracking on economic reforms risk a return to the financial crisis of 1997.\nWithout referring directly to the political crises that have stalled those changes in Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia, he said ''it would be a cruel irony indeed if the recovery stalled the changes that made the recovery possible.''\nIn both what he said this morning and what he omitted, Mr. Clinton appeared to acknowledge that the bold agenda for Asia he set out in November 1993 -- when he summoned a reluctant group of Asia's political leaders to Seattle for their first-ever summit meeting -- has been only partly achieved.\nWithout question, the region has come together economically, and Mr. Clinton ticked off the statistics today about how much trade has increased and poverty and child mortality have declined among the nations that make up the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation group. The member nations vary dramatically in size and wealth, from Russia and China to this tiny sultanate, which amounts to a shopping mall built atop a family-owned oil field.\nBut his 1993 concept of a far more cohesive political region has not come to pass. The level of mutual suspicions between Japan and China, China and Taiwan, Australia and Indonesia, and other nations scattered across the Pacific have diminished little in the last seven years. For example, Taiwan's new leader, Chen Shui-bian, still cannot attend the gathering because China still regards the country as a renegade province. So instead Taiwan sent its central bank governor, participating as a member ''economy.''\nThis morning, though, President Clinton insisted that his efforts to use economic relationships to foster political change has made considerable progress. He noted Washington's recent trade accords with China and Vietnam, where he goes on Thursday night, and said they amounted to ''declarations of interdependence'' for Communist nations that once reveled in their self-sufficiency.\nThe results of those accords, he said, are predestined: ''Dismantling command and control economies, giving their people more access to information and finally, I believe, giving people more freedom to use that information.''\nIn what appeared to be a response to complaints that his attention to the region has been periodic at best, Mr. Clinton asserted today that his administration had demonstrated ''that Asia is even more important to the United States after the cold war,'' and ''there is no longer any doubt our connections to this region are permanent, not passing.'' That included, he said, large troop presences in South Korea and Japan.\nHe indirectly acknowledged, however, that Asia's trade agenda has slowed dramatically, especially after the 1997 financial crisis and the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle late last year.\nHe said those trade talks should get restarted ''early next year,'' but offered no new ideas about how to bridge the bitter divide between developed nations and poor countries including many in Asia who pulled the plug on the negotiations. Those countries fear that the American insistence that countries adopt Western-style labor and environmental rules was simply a ploy to take away their competitive advantage.\nHe also noted that leaders in Asia have been only partly successful in translating their commitments here into economic openings and reforms at home.\nThose commitments often run into strong opposition from domestic industries, from banks to telecommunications firms, which fear an onslaught of American and other foreign competition.\nWhile such changes are difficult, he said, ''surely it can't be as hard as living through another crisis.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Indiana University opened its basketball season tonight without any of the furniture from the team bench being uprooted and transported across the basketball court, scattering fans. No player was head-butted or kicked in the shins by the coach, nor was the scorer's table punched.\nThis was, in fact, a new era for Indiana basketball.\nNone of the behavior that marked the tumultuous 29-year reign of Bob Knight as head basketball coach would be expected -- or tolerated -- from his successor. Mike Davis, a soft-spoken, mild-mannered man with a wide range of basketball experience, has taken over the team on an interim basis.\nIndiana played host to Pepperdine in Assembly Hall tonight. One man was conspicuous by his absence; Knight was reported to be in Spain, on a trip hunting red leg partridge.\nThere was virtually no sign of him in spirit, either. No signs of protest about the end of an era, inside or outside the arena. It isn't until Page 124 of a 192-page media guide that Knight is mentioned. In a souvenir shop in the arena, one of the few articles relating to Knight is a framed drawing of Looney Tunes characters on a basketball court, which he had autographed in a moment of levity. When the new coach was introduced before the game -- he wore a gray suit with tie in contrast to Knight's traditional fire-engine-red sweater -- he received a nice round of applause. And by the result of the game, anyway, Knight was hardly missed as Indiana won handily, 80-68.\nKnight, of course, was fired as Indiana's head coach on Sept. 10.\nAfter a series of misdeeds and transgressions, he was warned by the university president, Myles Brand, that there would be ''zero tolerance'' regarding any actions that might once again embarrass the university. But, as Knight has said, he did not understand what ''zero tolerance'' meant.\nWhen Knight defied the president, he was finally gone.\nDavis, who had been Knight's assistant the last three years, was with Knight when the coach allegedly grabbed and cursed at a student who had greeted Knight in a manner he considered disrespectful to an elder.\nOn the evening Knight was dismissed, he summoned Davis and another assistant coach to his home. Knight, Davis said, told them he would pay their salaries for a year -- Davis was making $95,000 -- if they wanted to leave Indiana but could not get jobs right away. When Davis, 40, was offered the Indiana job as interim coach, he accepted.\nDavis has not heard from Knight since, nor has he contacted Knight. In an interview after practice Monday, Davis would not comment about the situation. When asked what he learned from his predecessor, Davis did not refer to Knight, instead mentioning that he had been at a Miami Heat practice and was amazed at how great a coach Pat Riley was.\nDavis also mentioned other coaching mentors, people he had played for and observed, from Don Nelson to Phil Jackson. Davis has been an assistant at three other colleges, including his alma mater, Alabama, was cut from the Milwaukee Bucks' camp and played in European leagues and in the Continental Basketball Association.\nDavis did say that he developed a deeper appreciation of ''preparation and detail'' from Coach Knight.\nDuke Coach Mike Krzyzewski has said that Indiana's failures in the last several National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments were, in his opinion, because the Indiana players were so beaten down by the oppressive coach that they just wanted the season to end.\n''I'd rather not comment on that,'' Davis said. ''But Coach K, he's a great coach, too.''\nDavis's team this season is primarily freshmen and sophomores; there are no seniors. And it may not be a coincidence that Davis has said about this team, ''I want to let them play and have fun.''\nIt is hardly easy for someone to take over for a virtual icon, a coach won the second most games (661) in college basketball history. There have been questions about Davis's capabilities. The criticism and speculation have rankled him.\nDavis said he wanted a chance to prove himself. But when reminded that he was taking over one of the most historic and spectacular programs -- this year marks the 100th anniversary of Indiana men's basketball -- and told he had no coaching experience, Davis said: ''Oh no. I coached for two years in Venezuela.''\nThat was about 10 years ago, when he coached the country's national team for two summers as well as professional teams in that country.\nSome people in Indiana are hoping he will not succeed as coach, opening up the possibility for a big-name entry. Rumors already have Rick Pitino and Rick Majerus as candidates. But Davis had other concerns at the moment. There was Pepperdine, who upset Indiana in the first round of last year's N.C.A.A. tournament by 77-57.\nTonight's game marked the first round of the Preseason National Invitation Tournament. If Indiana wins and survives the next round, the Hoosiers will travel to New York City for the final two rounds on Nov. 25 and Nov. 27 at Madison Square Garden.\nAfter some initial first-game nervousness, and as the crowd cheered them on, the Hoosiers wore down Pepperdine with their defense and rebounding, and by playing a more uptempo game than Knight teams. Kirk Haston, a 6-foot-10-inch junior forward, scored 28 points to lead Indiana.\n''This is Coach Davis's team,'' Haston said. ''He's the leader. He rips guys when you mess up, and he'll pat you on the back when you deserve it. He called the right plays, and he settled us down -- especially the freshmen -- when it was needed.\n''He seems low-key,'' Haston added with a smile, ''but I definitely heard some words in the huddle that I'd heard in previous years.''\nDavis admitted that he was nervous before the game. He was asked if, after this victory, he was relieved.\n''That,'' Davis said, ''is an understatement.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "A prosecution witness in the bribery and racketeering trial of Milton Milan, Camden's mayor, testified today that in 1992 Mr. Milan, then just a first-time City Council candidate, asked for an introduction to Dominick Monaco, also known as Shorty, who held the city's lucrative towing contract.\n''He said Shorty was going to have trouble with his towing license because others were bidding on the contract,'' the witness, Saul Febo, a convicted drug dealer and longtime friend of Mr. Milan's, testified. ''Shorty said, 'Is this going to cost me money?' and Milan said, 'Everything costs money.' ''\nOn the sixth day of a trial that could last until late December, Mr. Febo was the ninth witness called by Renee M. Bumb, the assistant United States attorney who is prosecuting Mr. Milan.\nMs. Bumb maintains that Mr. Milan spent his time in public life -- as a City Council member, president of the Council and mayor -- avidly selling his office for bribes, taking money from the Philadelphia mob, laundering thousands of dollars in borrowed drug money, shaking down a city employee for a campaign contribution and misusing campaign funds for private trips with his girlfriend.\nIn all, there are 19 counts against Mr. Milan, 37, who is the third of the last four Camden mayors to be indicted while in office. He faces penalties ranging from five years in prison or $250,000 in fines for the majority of the counts to 20 years and a half-million-dollar fine for the charge that he conspired to launder money. Mr. Milan has maintained his innocence from the start. It is not known if he will take the stand in his own defense.\nIn today's session before Judge Joel A. Pisano of United States District Court, Ms. Bumb focused on favors she said Mr. Milan received from Nick's Towing of Pennsauken, the company Mr. Monaco and his wife, Kimberly, operated. Ms. Monaco, since divorced and now the president of the business, testified that she turned her GMC Jimmy over to the mayor in 1996 after an aide to the mayor said Mr. Milan needed a car for his campaign.\nAfter seven months, Mr. Monaco arranged to give Mr. Milan a minivan instead.\nMr. Monaco testified, ''I gave it to Milton figuring I'd get my Jimmy back, because my ex-wife, she was my wife at the time, was hounding me to get it back for her.''\nMr. Monaco laundered the van's title by giving it to Mr. Febo, who besides selling about $80,000 worth of cocaine a month, according to his testimony today, also ran Sal's Auto Sales in East Camden. Mr. Febo, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors under a threat of a life sentence for murder and drug conspiracies, issued a title in the name of Mr. Milan's wife, Kathryn.\nDuring this time, the city's towing contract with the Monacos was renewed each year, but early last year, when Ms. Monaco was running the towing company, her bid for a renewal was rejected and the mayor was refusing to take her calls, she testified today. She said she went to a friend in the Camden police to ask what he knew, and the officer put Ms. Monaco in touch with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was by then deep in its investigation into racketeering, drug dealing and money laundering in Camden.\nIn March 1999, Mr. Milan agreed to meet with Ms. Monaco, but not in either of their offices. When they met on March 30, Ms. Monaco was wearing an F.B.I. recorder.\nMs. Monaco approached the mayor, worried about rumors that the city was going to start its own towing service or award the contract to a competitor. According to a transcript of the conversation, the mayor said she did not have to worry.\n''I can't be in bed with everybody,'' he said.\nBut he warned her against bringing her concerns to him in City Hall.\nMayor Milan told her: ''I knew your family and stuff, so it's not just, ya know, you need an appointment with me to find out whatever,'' the transcript says. ''And in case you want to ask questions like that, I wouldn't want to be in City Hall answering.''\nMs. Monaco's contract, worth more than $200,000 a year in towing fees paid by drivers, was renewed until next summer.\nLast week, Ralph Natale, 69, the former boss of the Philadelphia and South Jersey organized crime syndicate, testified that he passed thousands of dollars in $100 bills -- ''I wouldn't insult him by giving him twenties,'' he testified -- to Mr. Milan in hopes of winning city contracts for several mob-fronted businesses. Although Mr. Natale was the prosecution's most colorful and dramatic witness so far, the mob conspiracy case may be its weakest, since the prosecution has not yet shown that the mob won any contracts.\nBut Ms. Bumb, the prosecutor, said she might call as many as 50 witnesses, including city contractors who have said in depositions that they installed new windows and air-conditioning and did other demolition work around the mayor's house to win city business or to speed up payment of money the city owed them."},

{"headline": null, "content": "President Clinton asked Congress today for an additional $750 million in emergency aid for Israel, Egypt and Jordan, a request that immediately drew a skeptical reaction from some influential Republican lawmakers.\nThe heart of the administration's request is $450 million to help Israel pay for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon and for countering long-range security threats from Iran and Iraq. Of that total, $250 million would go for the troop withdrawal and $200 million for military assistance, including the Arrow II antiballistic missile system. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been pressing Mr. Clinton to help defray the costs of the troop pullout, and administration officials said he renewed his plea when he met with the president here on Sunday.\nWith Mr. Clinton on a weeklong trip to Asia and Congress preparing to adjourn until Dec. 5, administration officials said it was important to send the request to Capitol Hill today, to allow lawmakers time to mull it over before they return.\nWith the Middle East peace effort that Mr. Clinton has worked to broker now in shambles, administration officials have sought ways to mitigate the long-term fallout. ''These requests will advance United States interests in the Middle East,'' Mr. Clinton said in a letter to congressional leaders.\nA senior Senate Republican aide said that senators, including Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, had not seen details of the request. Administration officials are to visit Capitol Hill on Thursday to brief senior aides. But the package faced a barrage of questions from influential Republicans, particularly the aid to Egypt.\nRepresentative Sonny Callahan of Alabama, who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, which oversees foreign aid, voiced skeptism over the thrust and timing of Mr. Clinton's request. ''I applaud the President's untiring efforts to help bring about a lasting peace to this important region of the world,'' Mr. Callahan said in a statement. ''That said, I remain very skeptical, especially in the waning days of the Clinton presidency, that a true, lasting peace agreement can be secured simply by promising even more money than has been promised before.''\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr. Callahan's counterpart on the Senate Appropriations Committee, has long voiced caution over providing additional military aid to Egypt. ''The question for Senator McConnell has been, What's the threat?'' said one Republican aide.\nIn addition to the assistance for Israel, the administration requested $225 million in military aid for Egypt for port and coastal security, which could strengthen Cairo's counterterrorism efforts. Officials acknowledged that the aid also amounted to rewarding the government of President Hosni Mubarak for its role in promoting the peace effort.\nMr. Clinton also asked for $75 million for Jordan: $25 million to improve security along its borders with Iraq and Syria and $50 million to help the Mideast ally's beleaguered economy.\nCongressional aides said it was politically unthinkable at a time of such roiling in the Middle East for the administration to request additional aid for Israel without also seeking extra assistance for Arab countries. Israel now receives $2.8 billion in annual aid and Egypt $2 billion, making them the two largest recipients of American assistance.\nAmerican aid to the Palestinian Authority is contained in separate legislation."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Denouncing ''the evils of political money,'' a bipartisan group of New Jersey political, business and civic officials, including former Gov. Jim Florio, announced yesterday that they had formed an advocacy group to fight for the overhaul of the state's campaign finance laws.\nThe organization, Citizens for the Public Good, criticized New Jersey's laws as ''far weaker'' than the federal government's, and contended that contributions from special interests now dominate the state's political system and thwart legislative action on a long list of major issues.\n''One feature of New Jersey's system virtually shouts out, 'If you want to play, you've got to pay,' '' the group said in a policy statement. ''Our democratic process may be distorted beyond recognition if we fail to reverse the omnipresent role of money in our political campaigns. Citizens for the Public Good believes we now face a threat to the public good that is critical.''\nThe statement said the threat was rooted in a ''grossly unfair'' local property tax system, ineffective laws on land use and environmental preservation, and the subordination of the ''long-term public interest'' to the short-term benefit of special interest groups.\nDuring a press conference in the State House, the group vowed to start a grass-roots campaign to rally public support before next year's elections for governor and for all 120 members of the Legislature.\nThe statement said that if the Legislature lacked the will to change campaign finance laws, the group would press for approval of a constitutional amendment allowing ''initiative and referendum'' on the issue.\nUnder this procedure, the group said, the public could petition the Legislature to enact reforms. If the Legislature still refused, the proposed changes would be submitted to voters on the ballot.\nIt was not clear who would draft the proposals.\nIn addition to Mr. Florio, the group has 25 other members, including Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former United States Attorney General; Henry Coleman, director of the center for government services at Rutgers University; Bruce Coe, a former president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association; Christopher Daggett, a former state environmental commissioner; Richard McGlynn, vice president of United Water Resources; and Franklin E. Parker, former chairman of the New Jersey Pinelands Commission.\nThe chairmen of the group are Candace Ashmun, a member of the Pinelands Commission; Gordon MacInnes, a former state senator from Morris County, and Senator William E. Schluter, a Hunterdon County Republican.\nDuring the news conference, Mr. Florio urged citizens to start pressuring their state legislators to change the laws. ''I think it is beyond dispute that money has become a disproportionate part of the political process,'' Mr. Florio said. ''It is becoming the entire process.''\nMr. MacInnes, a Democrat, agreed. ''We believe that the absence of comprehensive campaign finance reform is driving decisions in this building,'' he said of the State House. ''The people who benefit from the present rules are in charge of trying to change the present rules. That's not going to work.''\nThe organization was particularly critical of two laws. One, enacted while Mr. Florio was governor, allows for so-called ''Leadership PAC's'' controlled individually by the four leaders of the Legislature: the Senate president and minority leader, and the Assembly speaker and minority leader. Individuals can now contribute up to $30,000 a year to the funds. The amount increases to $37,000 next year. There is no limit on the total amount of money that can be amassed in the two PAC's.\nThe group also criticized a section of the law that allows individuals to contribute up to $1,800 a year to legislative candidates and to candidates for county freeholder boards and local school boards. Federal election law allows individuals to contribute up to $1,000 to candidates for president and the Congress.\nAs an example of what it called ''good public policy'' doomed by campaign contributions, the group cited the state Assembly's failure in 1999 to consider a bill that would have required developers of new housing projects or malls to help pay for new schools and roads necessitated by their projects. The group said that educational, municipal and professional planning groups, which do not make political contributions, all supported the measure as a way to control local property taxes. But lobbyists for homebuilders and real estate interests opposed it and made campaign contributions of nearly $500,000 to Assembly members in 1999. The bill quietly died."},
{"headline": null, "content": "When Americans trade stocks through TD Waterhouse, the third-largest discount broker in the United States, they are dealing with a Canadian bank. The same is true when they apply for a loan at Harris Bank in Chicago or withdraw cash from a SelectBank A.T.M. in a Safeway supermarket in California.\nAnd there is more to come. Led by the TD Bank Financial Group, which owns TD Waterhouse and Toronto Dominion Bank, four of the six companies that dominate financial services in Canada are making steady inroads into the United States. With consolidation and expansion restricted at home, they see their best opportunities for growth in a neighboring market that is 13 times the size, more diverse and more profitable.\n''We're fortunate that we have TD Waterhouse, and we don't see why we can't build an electronic banking platform around it,'' said Charles A. Baillie, chairman of TD Bank, the second largest in Canada. His goal is to get Waterhouse's three million American clients to open accounts at TD Waterhouse Bank and buy its mutual funds. To date, only 75,000 have done so.\nAbout 85 percent of TD Waterhouse's brokerage clients trade online, so they should be comfortable with online banking, Mr. Baillie said. But people are leery of banks that do not have branches and lots of A.T.M.'s, so TD Waterhouse is adding storefront outlets across the United States.\nThe challenge for Canadian banks is to adjust to a market with many more competitors, most of them unfamiliar. While hundreds of regional banks coexist with global giants in the United States, Canada's six largest banks control almost three-quarters of their home market. Having bought the big investment dealers and trust companies in the 1980's, they now also handle most of the trade in securities and manage huge mutual and pension funds.\nMergers among the six have been blocked by the government, which is concerned about the loss of consumer choice. Takeovers by foreign banks are also out; by law, the big banks must be 80 percent Canadian-owned.\n''Without mergers, they have no option but to grow outside of Canada,'' says Richard Hildebrand, a banking analyst at the Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto.\nDominant as they are at home, Canada's banks are slipping in relative size as those elsewhere merge. The Royal Bank of Canada, with assets of $178 billion in 1999, ranked 55th globally; in 1985, it was 32nd. The world's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, had assets of $844 billion last year. Bank of America, fifth in the world and No. 1 in the United States, had $633 billion.\nTo create bigger global competitors, the Royal Bank proposed buying Bank of Montreal in 1998, while the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce sought to merge with TD Bank. Finance Minister Paul Martin quashed both deals.\nThe government has since set out conditions under which mergers might be permitted. But bankers describe them as onerous, and are not counting on combining forces in the near future. For two banks in particular, denial of the mergers was a critical setback.\nHad Royal Bank merged with Bank of Montreal, which bought Harris Bank of Illinois in 1984, Harris could have been the base for expansion in the United States. Without it, Royal Bank is scrambling to catch up.\nRoyal Bank bought Dain Rauscher, a retail brokerage firm and investment banker based in Minneapolis, for $1.46 billion in September, just three months after acquiring the Liberty Life Insurance Company and the Liberty Insurance Services Corporation of Greenville, S.C., for $580 million.\nJohn Cleghorn, the bank's chairman, says there are opportunities to simultaneously sell brokerage, insurance and banking services in the United States. Canada forbids banks to sell insurance or finance auto leases in their branches.\nTD Bank made its pivotal move into the United States in 1996, buying Waterhouse Investor Services for $525 million. A year later, CIBC bought Oppenheimer & Company, a New York brokerage firm, and combined it with its Canadian securities firm, Wood Gundy, creating CIBC World Markets, a front-ranked player in corporate finance.\nCanadian bankers are choosy about investing south of the border, preferring to build on what has worked well at home -- managing money for the well-to-do and extending the reach of electronic banking. ''As smaller players in a fractionalized market, they can be good competitors,'' said Jamie Keating, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Canada in Toronto.\nCIBC has also ventured into retail banking in the United States. It operates Marketplace Banks at Winn-Dixie supermarkets in Florida and SelectBank at Safeway stores in California.\nExpansion is already paying off. The United States contributed 62 percent of TD Bank's 1999 profit of $835 million, according to the Dominion Bond Rating Service. At Bank of Montreal, it was 46 percent. CIBC's World Markets has provided more than half its parent's profit -- and more than half of that division's business is in the United States."},
{"headline": null, "content": "THERE are policies on the books, unenforced for years, that are suddenly being pulled out and thrust in our faces,'' a business traveler groused in a recent e-mail message describing the way his company has begun tightening up on travel and entertainment expenses.\n''The killer is the $10 limit on breakfasts,'' he added. ''I've yet to stay in a hotel in a major city where breakfast can be had for anything near $10.'' His solution: get up earlier and leave the hotel in search of the kind of decent breakfast one can get for $10 at, say, a Denny's -- even though to do that ''I might end up taking a cab. No limit on expenses there!''\nGriping about company travel and entertainment policies is a popular pastime, especially now with companies trying to put some rein on galloping business travel costs.\nSome complaints come from employees at tight-fisted companies where a $12 breakfast or a $125 hotel room is suddenly an expense-account red flag. But even at the other end of the spectrum, at companies where employees hit the road with a degree of comfort, convenience and even sometimes a touch of luxury, life on the road isn't what it used to be. For one thing, freedom of choice is being limited.\n''I can still stay in a $350-a-night hotel,'' said a woman who works for a big telecommunications company. ''The difference now is, I don't get to choose the hotel anymore. My company tells me which chain I have to use -- and I'm not happy about that at all.''\nCorporate travel analysts say that this year appears to be a pivotal one for business travel, which will cost domestic companies more than $175 billion this year, according to the National Business Travel Association. One major change is that formal travel policies are being drafted or dusted off and put into use after years of relative laxity.\nThis year, for example, the percentage of companies with written travel policies increased to 83 percent from 72 percent, according to the 2000 Survey and Analysis of Business Travel Policies and Costs, a study conducted every two years by Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm.\nMore than half of the nearly 200 companies surveyed said that their spending on travel increased in 1999, according to Runzheimer, which found that the average domestic trip of three days cost a total of $970 and the average international trip of seven days cost $3,455.\nAccording to the new American Express Survey of Business Travel Management 2000-2001, which interviewed corporate travel planners at more than 400 medium-size and big companies, travel and entertainment costs are the second-largest controllable corporate cost, after salaries. The survey suggests persuasively that the era of constraints has arrived -- even if the $350-a-night hotel room and the $3,500 international business-class sleeper seat remain alive and well in some quarters.\nAmerican Express said that 63 percent of the companies surveyed are now negotiating volume discounts with preferred airlines, compared with 44 percent in the last survey two years ago. At many companies, this means employees are no longer able to book trips as often on their favorite airlines (and manipulate their frequent-flier accounts as easily as they once did).\nBusiness air fares have gone up 40 percent in less than five years, with the sharpest increases this year. This is prompting what American Express calls ''a new urgency'' among corporations to put tighter controls on travel.\nReflecting this, 65 percent of the surveyed companies said that they now encouraged -- and 11 percent said they required -- employees to book nonrefundable fares. These are the cheaper advance-purchase tickets, which business travelers typically regard as less convenient because they restrict last-minute changes.\nStill, the luxury market is holding its own, especially in hotels. The Runzheimer study, for example, found that about 28 percent of business travelers use full-service luxury hotels.\nAccording to still another survey, this one by the PricewaterhouseCoopers hospitality and leisure group, top hotels are competing for guests by adding amenities like in-room massages, fresh flowers, DVD players, air purifiers, 300-count bed sheets, expensive sound systems, fish tanks and the like. Luxury hotels now represent 18 percent of the hotel rooms in the United States -- and will represent 26 percent once properties now under construction open.\nBjorn Hanson, the hotel consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that in this economy companies were trying to maintain a delicate balance between controlling costs and maintaining morale, especially the morale of the most valued top employees who are traveling.\n''At any given time, even when the business cycle is good and the economy is strong, about one in five companies is getting stricter with corporate travel policies,'' he said. ''But even at the 20 percent that's cracking down, it's not affecting the very high-end travelers as much.''\nHe added: ''Because of the demand for those employees -- meaning the opportunity for those folks to go anywhere else and get a job -- no one wants to have the travel department offending them. So companies are saying to their corporate travel departments, with air fares and car rentals and hotels all going up, can't you do something? But when you do, please don't cause any decrease in morale or get people mad at us. As a result, travel departments are really caught in an awkward position.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "Two states' overwhelming approval of ballot initiatives last week to require background checks at weekend gun shows is prompting advocates of gun control to predict that the incoming Congress might pass legislation that creates a similar federal law.\nEven gun-rights organizations like the National Rifle Association, which fought the efforts in both states, Colorado and Oregon, say the time might be right for a bipartisan agreement.\nBut despite passage in what both sides consider as ''pro-gun'' states, the success in getting any national law continues to hinge on how long it will take for the checks to be completed.\n''It's clear that the votes indicate that in two relatively pro-gun states, a very large percentage of voters approve closing the gun-show loophole,'' said Michael Barnes, president of Handgun Control Inc., a private organization that works for gun-control laws. ''Congress no longer has any excuse to block this kind of common-sense legislation.''\nBill Powers, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said, ''Hopefully, we can make some minor adjustments in the legislative process and resolve this once and for all.''\nThe measures in Colorado and Oregon require buyers of guns from unlicensed dealers to pass the same kind of criminal background checks that federally licensed dealers are required to perform, and they bring to 11 the number of states in which all sales are now treated the same.\nThe Colorado measure passed with 69.9 percent approval. Oregon's passed with 62 percent. The initiatives won a place on the ballot in both states after Republican-controlled Legislatures refused to approve similar measures that the governors -- Bill Owens, a Republican, in Colorado, and John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, in Oregon -- had said they would sign into law.\nThe other states with similar laws are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.\nThe problem with writing national legislation that reflects the intent of the states is that states conduct their checks in different ways and have waiting periods for completion of the sale that vary from right away to, in New York's case, as long as six months. Efforts in Congress last year to close the gun-show loophole failed after House and Senate negotiators could not agree on whether weekend buyers should have to wait as long as three business days, which many Democrats and Handgun Control favored, or just 24 hours, as many Republicans and the National Rifle Association preferred.\nMr. Powers described the length of the waiting period as one of the minor adjustments that could be made to pass legislation. But Mr. Barnes said it remained the most critical component of any federal legislation because so many states, 34, depend upon the National Instant Check System for their background checks, and for weekend dealers who set up shop for only a day or two, the system is not very instant at all.\nColorado, Oregon and 14 other states use state law enforcement agencies for their background checks, a procedure that officials on both sides of the debate prefer to the national system because state agencies have easier and faster access to the local police and court records that would stop a sale. States' checks often clear purchases the same day the prospective buyer wants a gun. Neither measure approved last week included a time limit for background checks.\nBoth Handgun Control and the National Rifle Association agree that if all states had the apparatus to conduct background checks, as Colorado and Oregon do, passing federal legislation would be much simpler.\nBut for now, the states represent a hodge-podge of regulations, including some, like those in Minnesota, that require background checks at weekend shows for handguns and assault weapons but no check of someone who buys a shotgun.\nHere in Colorado, the issue has been especially emotional because the thrust for closing the loophole came directly out of the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School. All four weapons used by the two teenage killers had been bought at gun shows without background checks. Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old friend of the killers, bought three of the guns, a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns. Another friend, Mark Manes, bought the fourth gun, a TEC-DC9 assault pistol, and later sold it to the killers.\nMr. Manes was later sentenced to six years in prison. Ms. Anderson was not prosecuted because at the time no law prevented her from buying the ''long guns'' from an unlicensed dealer.\nAn effort to change regulations that would have required Ms. Anderson to submit to a background check was part of a package of gun measures Governor Owens supported in the legislative session that followed the Columbine shootings. The effort failed by a single vote in committee. Ms. Anderson told officials that if she had had to submit to a background check, she would not have bought the guns.\nLater, a grass-roots organization formed to collect signatures to put the matter of background checks before the public as a ballot initiative. Local gun-rights groups, backed by $500,000 from the National Rifle Association, strongly opposed the measure.\nThe Oregon measure reached voters as a ballot initiative after traveling a similar path. It gained impetus as a bill in the Legislature after a school shooting in Springfield, Ore., but failed by a single vote in the State Senate.\nAfter it became apparent that the two ballot initiatives were going to pass, lawmakers from other states, including Arizona and Washington, contacted Handgun Control, seeking help with writing bills that would resemble the initiatives in Colorado and Oregon. And Mr. Barnes said he had been contacted by several Democratic and Republican senators who told him they would like to introduce gun-show legislation in the next Congress.\nWhether the next president would support such an effort remains to be seen."},
{"headline": null, "content": "THE MYSTERY OF THE ALEPH\nMathematics, Kabala and the Search for Infinity\nBy Amir D. Aczel\nIllustrated. 258 pages. Four Walls Eight Windows. $24.95.\nLet's start with Zeno's paradox. Many books on mathematics do, including Amir D. Aczel's previous work, an excellent account of the solution to the mathematical mystery known as Fermat's Last Theorem. His new work, ''The Mystery of the Aleph,'' also includes the indispensable Zeno, who proved that you can never walk out of a room, since, before you can go a full distance, you have to go half that distance, forever. Or, as Mr. Aczel puts this, ''Zeno used this paradox to argue that under the assumption of infinite divisibility of space and time, motion can never even start.''\nInfinity is one of those eerie subjects that rubs up equally against religion, philosophy and science, and Mr. Aczel would seem to be a good person to lure us into its inner recesses. His book on the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem was a model of lucid explanation of arcane matters for nonspecialists, and this new book starts out promising much the same with the concept of infinity.\nMr. Aczel is very good at portraying the essences of the thoughts and lives of that quirky class of geniuses known as mathematicians, and he goes back not just to Zeno but to such other fascinating pioneers of number theory as Pythagoras and Eudoxus to do so. He deepens our appreciation of their discoveries by linking them to the equally deep, nonmathematical musings of the Kabalists, for whom infinity was a mystical equivalent to the immensity of God.\nAnd yet, while there is much of interest in this new effort to explicate deep mathematical conundrums to ordinary people, Mr. Aczel does not entirely succeed in this new book. I say this fully aware that for mathematical laymen like myself it is not always easy to determine whether incomprehension is your fault or the author's. Perhaps there is a little of both in ''The Mystery of the Aleph,'' but certainly Mr. Aczel makes only passing efforts to lead his readers gently through the thicket of difficult concepts that he presents.\nReading this book, I often had the feeling that I was on the verge of Understanding. And then it would elude me because, or so it seemed, Mr. Aczel's text was too shorthanded, too quick, insufficiently attentive to my needs.\nHe begins by introducing Georg Cantor, the German mathematician who in the 1870's devised an equation using the aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, to describe a property of infinity. The equation is a short one, but, Mr. Aczel writes, it is ''the most enduring mystery in mathematics.''\nA single formula that purports to hold within itself the deepest mysteries of existence: the idea rings with all sorts of spiritual and scientific implications. The drama deepens because at least two of the mathematicians who explored the mystery most avidly -- Cantor and Kurt Godel -- went mad, with Cantor dying in 1918 in a psychiatric hospital in the German university town of Halle.\nHaving set the scene with Cantor, Mr. Aczel surveys the history of the scientific effort to cope with the question of infinity through the ages. He shows us Galileo, for example, whose treatise ''On Two New Sciences'' has his character Salviati explaining that a circle is made up of infinitely many, infinitely small triangles. That much seems clear enough, but Mr. Aczel quickly careens into murkier territory. Still summarizing Galileo, he writes that ''an infinite set, the set of all whole numbers, is shown to be 'equal in number' to the set of all squares of whole numbers, which is a proper subset of the set of whole numbers.''\nIf you understand that last sentence, you will probably have no great difficulty understanding the rest of Mr. Aczel's account, which relies heavily on set theory to make many of its points. In the instance of Galileo, Mr. Aczel does what the best writers on difficult subjects do -- he takes his reader by the hand and explicates matters by returning to basics -- in this instance what exactly it means when we count numbers.\nThe counterintuitive Galilean proposition that an infinite set of things can be equal to a part of itself becomes less murky as Mr. Aczel introduces an idea developed by the mathematician David Hilbert, the Infinite Hotel, which does enlarge one's understanding of the paradoxical properties of infinity. Too often, however, Mr. Aczel races so quickly through difficult concepts that I suspect many readers will feel left behind, as I did.\nThis is especially the case with some of the key notions discussed by Mr. Aczel, namely the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. One has to do with the number of numbers that can occupy points along a line; the other is a proposition hotly contested by mathematicians that deals with -- well, actually, despite several readings of Mr. Aczel's passages on this subject, I can't summarize what it deals with.\nI can do better as Mr. Aczel proceeds to an account of a famous monkey wrench thrown into the infinity works by a vexing paradox discovered by Bertrand Russell: If the barber of Seville shaves all the men of Seville who do not shave themselves, does he shave himself? If he does, he doesn't, and if he doesn't, he does. That is marvelously intriguing and it bears on the nature of infinity, though in ways that Mr. Aczel does not make fully clear.\nAnd yet, despite these difficulties, Mr. Aczel's book remains highly enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. It deals, after all, with great minds venturing into the farthest reaches of speculation, with the nature of endlessness itself, both mathematical and religious, subjects that were not meant to be easy."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Marvin Abugov does not regret investing in strong double-paned windows for Beth Israel, a six-month-old synagogue. A few hours before dawn on Nov. 1, someone threw a rock and then a gasoline bomb at one window. The bomb bounced off the inner pane, flaming harmlessly against a red brick outside wall.\n''They wanted to burn the building down,'' said Mr. Abugov, leader of the $4 million building campaign for Beth Israel, as he showed a visitor the damage. ''We have not even paid for this building, and it is already desecrated.''\nThat morning, while one fire truck raced through suburban streets to douse flames at the synagogue here, another was already downtown after a firebomb attack on another prominent synagogue, Beth Shalom. It was the second time in a month that someone had thrown a gasoline bomb at Beth Shalom.\nIn an echo of violence in the Middle East, Canadian Jews have been subjected to a wave of attacks that community leaders say are unprecedented. During the last six weeks, about 45 anti-Jewish incidents -- arson, assaults, verbal abuse and death threats -- have been recorded in Canada.\n''Arson attacks in Canada have been very rare -- to record five against synagogues in one month is amazing,'' said Manuel Prutschi, national director for community relations of the Canadian Jewish Congress.\nFirmly established for decades, Canada's Jewish population of about 350,000 is the fourth largest outside of Israel, after the United States, Russia and France. A new book this fall celebrated the centennial of Edmonton's Jewish minority. It noted that many Jews have risen to establishment positions, with some becoming city councilmen, presidents of the University of Alberta, or owners of the city's football and hockey teams. The number of Jews here has doubled during the last quarter-century to about 6,000, fed with an influx of Russian Jews from the Soviet Union and of Montreal Jews unhappy with separatist politics in Quebec.\nJewish spokesmen say the anti-Jewish violence seen in Canada this fall is far greater than the anti-Semitic violence seen during the Persian Gulf war a decade ago. In the last six weeks, bricks have been thrown through synagogue windows in Toronto, and anti-Jewish graffiti has been scrawled on Jewish shops and institutions in other Ontario cities. In the worst of four reported assaults on Jews, a Jewish man was severely beaten in Montreal by a group of Palestinians, according to B'nai B'rith Canada.\nSome of the graffiti and telephoned death threats have referred to Hamas and Hezbollah, two militant Islamic groups that maintain support groups in Canada, according to Canadian intelligence officials.\nWith Jewish citizens and institutions bearing the brunt of the violence, many Canadians Jews are livid over what they describe as a tepid response by politicians. After a 20-year-old local man of Palestinian origin was arrested here and charged with the firebomb attack on Beth Shalom, Mayor Bill Smith suggested that the arson charge be reduced to vandalism, apparently because the attack took place a few hours after Halloween night. Anne McLellan, Canada's justice minister, declined to say whether the attack constituted a hate crime, saying such a decision was up to the provincial prosecutor.\nAlvin Goldsman, president of the Jewish Federation of Edmonton, said, ''Leadership in the country, at all levels -- whether political or religious -- has been deafeningly silent when it comes to condemning these actions.''\nWith a national election set for Nov. 27, the lukewarm response by politicians of the governing Liberal Party, combined with a Canadian vote cast last month in the United Nations, could break Jews' historic political ties with Liberals. Jewish spokesmen complain that a United Nations resolution approved by Canada on Oct. 7 exclusively blamed Israel for the violence in the Middle East.\nThe National Post, a conservative newspaper edited in Toronto, made a link last week between what it called Canada's ''winking at Palestinian violence'' in its United Nations vote and the fact that ''anti-Jewish attacks in Canada have skyrocketed.''\n''Domestic anti-Semitism is hardly surprising when the government signs a venomously anti-Israeli U.N. resolution,\" the newspaper wrote."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Scott Boras lives on the West Coast but works in his own time zone, so it's not uncommon to get a phone call from him at any hour. Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, received a call from Boras late Monday night. News reports had filtered their way to California, and Boras realized that his client, the free-agent All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez, might have lost his biggest suitor.\n''Are you out of this?'' Boras said incredulously.\n''Well, I thought I told you that,'' Phillips responded.\nPhillips and Boras continued to disagree yesterday as they gave their versions of their abbreviated negotiations to the news media. And while dealing with the fallout from his stunning announcement, Phillips spent the day pursuing other avenues:\n*Phillips met with Arn Tellem, the agent for the free-agent starting pitcher Mike Mussina, an indication Phillips may be ready to move on after talks stalled with Mike Hampton.\n*The Mets' chances of re-signing the free-agent pitcher Rick Reed worsened when they learned that the Dodgers had made Reed an offer surpassing $23 million for three years.\n*And the Mets have spoken with Denny Neagle, whose agent said ''there's no question he'd be interested'' in pitching for the Mets.\nEven as those possibilities percolated, Phillips could not hide from the second-guessing about why the Mets had dropped out of the Rodriguez negotiations without making an offer.\n''I'm trying not to kill Scott or anybody on this,'' Phillips said. ''He's asking for things that he feels are necessary. They're things I'm not ready to do.''\nPhillips explained Monday that Boras's off-the-field requests amounted to preferential treatment that would divide the clubhouse. Boras said yesterday that his nonmonetary requests were not contractual demands. Boras added that he was asking for less contractually than what other comparable superstars had received. He cited the luxury box that is promised to the Mets' Mike Piazza and the luxury car and first-class plane tickets the Cardinals gave Mark McGwire in his contract.\n''This is absolutely a misrepresentation of what I told him,'' Boras said, referring to Phillips.\nPhillips met with Boras for two hours at last week's general managers' meetings in Amelia Island, Fla. Boras handed Phillips the now-infamous hard-bound volume of Rodriguez's accomplishments at age 25.\nAccording to Boras, Phillips said of the book: ''My owners would really like to look at this. Do you have two more?''\nYet, almost immediately the Mets were turned off.\nPhillips responded, ''I know what he's saying now, but I'm telling you he made it clear to me and I heard it elsewhere: this is the necessary structure.''\nBoras thought he had alleviated Phillips's concerns in a telephone conversation Monday afternoon, one hour before Phillips announced to reporters that the Mets were no longer interested in Rodriguez. Boras said he told Phillips then that he wanted ''no amenities beyond the normal and customary contract.'' Boras said he left that conversation thinking Phillips would call back but was soon stunned when he heard otherwise.\n''I think he wants us in it,'' Phillips said. ''I think that the likelihood is he'll get what he wants from somebody, and I think the specter of having us in it has value to him.''\nRodriguez does not require his own plane, Boras said, or a stadium suite. Boras said that the Mariners had supplied a conference room outside the team clubhouse so Rodriguez's marketing staff could handle his off-field schedule, but that Rodriguez hired his own marketing company and paid for his own flights for personal business.\nBut Boras asked Phillips what type of marketing plan the Mets would provide Rodriguez and how his teammates would feel about the attention. Another baseball official confirmed that Boras had requested that Rodriguez receive a bigger billboard presence around New York than the Yankees' Derek Jeter, that the Mets supply a tent in spring training to sell Rodriguez souvenirs and that Rodriguez been given a review of the minor league system.\n''Alex is a great kid, so why would he authorize me to do all this?'' Boras said.\nEven providing a room to house Rodriguez's staff would create a major distraction, Phillips said.\nRodriguez has not ruled out the Mets if they resume their pursuit, said Boras, who said he had spoken with 13 or 14 teams and received multiple offers since teams were allowed to begin negotiations last Saturday.\nPhillips maintained that the Mets' need for pitching and its escalating cost did not scare him from Rodriguez's asking price: $25 million a season for 12 years.\nPhillips remained busy on other fronts. His meeting with Mussina's agent may indicate that the Mets are ready to spend some of the money allotted for Rodriguez and Hampton. Mussina's agent is expected to meet with Yankees officials today. Mussina, who turns 32 next month, is seeking a seven-year contract worth $16 million to $17 million a season.\nHampton, who spent one season with the Mets, turned 28 in September. Phillips said he believes New York is not a compelling enough reason for Hampton to return.\nThe Mets have not changed their offer to Hampton since before spring training, and yesterday's Mussina meeting may be Phillips's way of calling Hampton's bluff or of replacing him.\nNeagle is another possibility. His agent, Barry Meister, has twice spoken with Phillips but has yet to receive an offer. Neagle is seeking at least $10 million a year for a minimum of four years. The Indians are also interested in Neagle, and the Yankees have not ruled out re-signing him. Meanwhile, Phil Tannenbaum, Reed's agent, said he was very close to a deal with the Dodgers, who offered four years (or three years and an option) in excess of $23 million on Sunday. Tannenbaum was awaiting a response to a counteroffer he made Monday. He said he plans to run any serious offers pastPhillips, who has not increased his offer of three years.\n''They haven't even gotten to $20 million,'' Tannenbaum said. ''I wouldn't call it a joke because I respect Steve.''\nPhillips may also need to act quickly on John Franco, the reliever who is one of the Mets' five free-agent pitchers. The Phillies made offers to three relievers on Monday, and Franco was believed to be one of them. Franco, who lives in Staten Island, would be a closer for Philadelphia but a setup man to Armando Benitez if he returned to the Mets."},

But what Riley will see is Scott being ejected with two technical fouls in just his seventh game on the sideline.\n''When I saw him in the preseason, we had just come off a four-hour practice and he gave me grief about that,'' Scott said of Riley, his former coach with the Los Angeles Lakers.''This was the worst game to get kicked out of because we play him next and I know the first thing he'll say is that he never got kicked out or something to that extent. He's kicked down some doors and put some holes in chalk boards. He had his share of going off on us when we didn't do the things we were supposed to be doing. I learned real well.''\nAs he prepared the Nets yesterday to face Riley and the Miami Heat tonight, Scott was also aware that his relationship with Riley could change if the Nets were to beat the Heat, a lesson Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy learned as the rivalry between the Knicks and Heat escalated.\n''Our relationship was a rough relationship when I was in Los Angeles, Scott said. It's gotten better over the years. And I think since I've been a coach, we've talked about three or four times and it's gotten a lot better. Most of it is due to that he's older and I'm older. I'm a little wiser and he's a lot wiser. I now understand all the methods and the madness, the stuff that we were doing.''\n''But you know what, things can change. Anthony Carter could take Stephon Marbury out and I'd go crazy.''\nScott has endured troubles in his first month on the job beyond getting ejected on Monday as the Nets' record dropped to 3-4. Last week, he criticized his team for a lack of effort, something he hoped would not be necessary so soon. Still, he expects to be under control when he faces Riley, at least until the two go to battle.\n''Whatever stuff we get into in the heat of the battle, it's because of the heat of the battle, Scott said.

{"headline": null, "content": "Forty years ago, a 6-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges marched past an angry mob of segregationists to become the first black child to attend William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans.\nFor much of that year, white parents kept their children home, preferring no school at all to sharing a room with a black classmate, so Ruby sat alone, learning reading and math with a first-grade teacher she would come to think of as her best friend.\nThat story, which inspired a Norman Rockwell painting and a lifelong interest in the morality of children in the psychiatrist Robert Coles, was told again yesterday. This time, it was told by Ms. Bridges herself, to an integrated classroom of about 20 eager and attentive first graders at Public School 111, the Adolph S. Ochs Elementary School, in the Clinton section of Manhattan.\nAn outgrowth of Scholastic Reads, a program in which employees of Scholastic, the children's publishing and media company, read and supply books to public elementary students throughout the city, yesterday's event marked the 40th anniversary of Ms. Bridges' civil rights contribution.\n''I like to share my story with children, and they are amazed by the story,'' said Ms. Bridges, who travels the country talking about her experiences and has formed a foundation to promote tolerance.\n''I think they are able to put themselves in this little girl's place, and to relate to that child and to think about how they would feel going to an empty school and having no friends.''\nInside the classroom, the walls were festooned with the children's work, much of it dedicated to Ms. Bridges. Drawings inspired by the children's reading of ''The Story of Ruby Bridges,'' by Dr. Coles, who met her shortly after she entered William Frantz Elementary, hung from a cord across the room like Christmas lights.\nThe captions, written by the students, read: ''I learned to make friends with my teacher,'' or ''I learned to be brave'' or ''I learned that you have to believe in yourself.''\nThe names of some of the students tell the story of how far things have come since Ms. Bridges was a first grader: Francisco, Jasmeen, Chloe, Megan. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed, predominantly Irish, Hispanic and black, and the school reflects that, said Sheri Donovan, the principal.\nWaiting for Ms. Bridges to arrive about 1 p.m. and dwarfed by the presence of about a dozen journalists, the children at first sat neatly on the floor, in ''movie theater rows,'' well back from the chair reserved for the guest of honor.\n''She's not used to people touching her feet like I am,'' the teacher, Jennifer Klingher, told the class.\nBut as soon as Ms. Bridges entered, the rows were abandoned and a happy pandemonium erupted, with a few of the children questioning whether she was really the girl in the story.\n''I am Ruby, but I'm Ruby all grown up,'' Ms. Bridges said good-naturedly. ''Watch. When you get older, you're going to look different, too.''\nAfter shaking each child's hand, she proceeded to read ''The Story of Ruby Bridges,'' again and again emphasizing that it is about a little girl changing the law, ''so all you guys could go to school together.''\n''Isn't that great?'' she said.\nThroughout the reading, students pointed out their favorite pages in the book or sang out answers to Ms. Bridges questions.\n''Why are they yelling at Ruby?'' a girl named Jasmeen asked when Ms. Bridges paused on an illustration depicting her, escorted by federal marshals, braving a screaming crowd outside her school.\n''Why are they yelling at Ruby?'' Ms. Bridges asked the class.\n''Because they don't want a black kid in their school,'' another girl, Jasmin, answered.\nLater, when Ms. Bridges stopped on a page depicting her class alone with her teacher, one student asked what the teacher was doing.\n''Teaching me my numbers,'' she responded before asking, ''Do you do that in this class?''\nAs the children clamored to answer ''Yes,'' one boy began counting, rapidly and under his breath, without pause until he passed 30.\nAfter finishing the story, Ms. Bridges asked the students if they could have done what she did.\n''Yes,'' they cried.\n''You wouldn't have been lonely?''\n''No,'' came the chorus, as one girl explained, ''I have my teddy bear in my backpack.''\nWhen it was the students' turn to ask questions, they wanted to know more about Ms. Bridges. Does she have children (yes, four sons) and where does she live (New Orleans).\nAt the end, after showing the children her own book, ''Through My Eyes,'' published by Scholastic last year, and talking about how she came to write it, one boy, Ashanti, sat quietly with his hand stretched high, waiting patiently to be called on by Ms. Bridges.\nAshanti had spent most of the session on the periphery of the group, sitting on Ms. Donovan's lap or with his head on a pillow, but now he had something to say: ''Thanks for changing the law.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Randy Johnson was so skeptical about his chances of winning the National League's Cy Young Award yesterday, he told a public relations official from the Arizona Diamondbacks that he planned to play golf in the afternoon. The official begged Johnson to postpone his outing and wait for a potentially important call.\nSo the doubting Johnson changed his plans and was pleasantly rewarded when he was called and told that he had won the Cy Young for the second straight year and the third time in his career. Despite a slump in the second half of the season, Johnson earned 22 of the 32 first-place votes to finish as an overpowering winner over Atlanta's Tom Glavine.\nJohnson went 19-7 with a 2.64 earned run average and a major league-leading 347 strikeouts and received 133 points on 22 firsts, seven seconds and three thirds. Glavine, who got four firsts and 64 points, was 21-9 with a 3.40. Greg Maddux, Glavine's teammate and a four-time Cy Young winner, finished third with three firsts and 59 points after going 19-9 with a 3.00.\n''The competition was very tight,'' said the 37-year-old Johnson. ''I think had you asked every month during the course of the season, there easily could have been a different winner. I think that's how strong the pitchers threw this year.''\nBecause Johnson blazed to a 14-2 record with a 1.80 at the All-Star Game break and fizzled to 5-5 with a 3.81 when the Diamondbacks faded in the second half, there was some speculation that Glavine might slide ahead of him and win his third Cy Young. Even Johnson wondered whether winning five times in his last 16 starts while Glavine and Maddux led Atlanta to their ninth straight division title might deprive him of the award.\n''I wish I would have finished a little bit stronger, but I still feel I had, from start to finish, a pretty good year,'' Johnson said. ''Obviously, I didn't finish like I started.''\nA day after Pedro Martinez won his third Cy Young Award, Johnson did the same and said that he felt a ''great deal of satisfaction'' from being mentioned with the likes of Roger Clemens, Steve Carlton, Sandy Koufax, Tom Seaver and Jim Palmer. But Johnson, who joined Maddux (1992-1995) and Koufax (1965-66) as the only N.L. pitchers to win the award in at least two straight seasons, was most proud of winning at an age when many power pitchers have retired.\n''I think every year, as I get older, it's harder to put the numbers up,'' Johnson said. ''I think the biggest gratification I got is I'm doing it at an age, last year at 36 and this year at 37, where a lot of people thought I might be over the hill, after having back surgery as well.''\nIf someone had predicted 10 or 12 years ago that he would win three Cy Youngs, Johnson admitted ''a lot of people would have laughed.'' Now Johnson, who turns 38 in September, has two years left on his contract. He was being asked if he thought about trying to corral two more Cy Youngs to duplicate the record of five that Clemens has already won.\n''My major goal is to get to a World Series,'' said Johnson, who earned a $500,000 bonus for winning the award. ''A lot of people talked about that when Roger Clemens had his Cy Youngs. But the major thing left in his career was to win a World Series. Obviously, he did it. I haven't. I haven't been to a World Series, let alone win one.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Leaders of the 30-year struggle to clean up Chesapeake Bay are moving their headquarters here to an avant-garde beachfront office center concocted from the stuff of old pickle barrels and modern geothermal pumps. The airy, innovative structure is already being hailed by environmental advocates as the ''greenest'' office building yet devised.\nDesigned to combine cutting-edge technology with the latest techniques in recycling and environmental protection, the new office center of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation looks out upon the bay like a long, surreal chalet dedicated to natural materials and workers who like to bike and kayak to the office.\nThe building glistens on the shore as a two-story utilitarian experiment in reprocessed wood, reclaimed metal and louvered panoramic windows. It will use less than one-third the energy and one-tenth the water of a conventional office building, say officials of the foundation, the nonprofit group dedicated to protecting the bay's environment from the pollution problems of modern development.\n''We wanted a 'green' building, not something finished in marble and trimmed in walnut,'' said Charles D. Foster, a foundation director, as he showed how the center, using materials like bamboo and cork, would accommodate 100 workers with the latest in waterless compost toilets and bay-breeze ventilation.\nThe new Philip Merrill Environmental Center, named for a publisher who is a principal patron of the foundation, has received the highest rating for excellence from the United States Green Building Council, an industry group that sets standards for pro-environment construction.\n''This is top of the chart,'' said Donna McIntire, an architect with the council, ''a building meant to be an educational tool in line with the foundation's mission.''\nTo minimize disruption, the center was designed to fit the ''footprint'' or ground area of a century-old inn and swimming pool complex razed in the construction project. And most of the building materials were obtained within 300 miles of the center to lessen the strain of transportation pollution on the environment.\n''Interestingly, it was the neighbors who asked us to buy the site because they were all worried about some of the plans housing developers had,'' said William C. Baker, president of the foundation.\nThe foundation decided to turn the 31-acre site in this secluded residential community into a showcase for pro-environment workplace techniques and materials, he said.\n''We decided if we didn't do it, how can we ask other people to do it?'' Mr. Baker said of the innovations and experiments at the center.\nIn one innovation, every drop of rooftop rainwater is to be salvaged through an elaborate cistern system using recycled pickle barrels to avoid the damaging runoff problems that plague the bay's ecology.\nBarrel staves were also used as slats in the system of louvers designed to screen out hot summer sun but admit needed winter warmth.\n''It was a challenge,'' said Tom Eichbaum of SmithGroup Inc., the principal architect of the $11.6-million center, estimating the paybacks would extend beyond energy and water savings to workers' productivity.\nAmong the features favored by foundation environmentalists are a sensor system that will shut down air-conditioning and signal workers to open windows when bay breezes are right. The office's heat pump system circulates 300 feet deep to 48 geothermal wells that tap into the earth's constant 50-degree temperature below the frost line. This will help cool the building in summer and warm it in winter. The roof holds solar panels that store energy and produce heat for wash water.\nThe center has large, ski-lodge-sized framing timbers that were made by laminating together short pieces of second-growth wood, a method designed to spare prime forest woods. With similar care, cork was chosen for the floors because it is a bark that, once stripped, is naturally renewed without destroying trees. And ceiling tiles are made from recycled paper.\n''With all the new bells and whistles we have in this place, this is what people tend to focus on,'' Mr. Foster said of the waterless compost toilets.\nActually, they are not such an innovation. Earlier models have been used in other foundation offices for 20 years, he noted. Using an aerobic, odorless compost method, the system eventually produces fertile garden soil that will be used on the center's grounds, Mr. Foster said.\nNo less care is being devoted by foundation workers to the surrounding outdoors bordered by the bay and Black Walnut Creek. The land had deteriorated across decades when it was used as a picnic grounds. But native grasses are being replanted and oyster reefs restored in line with the foundation's role as a naturalist training center.\nRoaming the grounds, William Street, an environmental advocate, took stock of foxes, otters, muskrats and other neighbors, including some affluent human householders across the creek. He emphasized that, as a new arrival, the foundation would take care in introducing change.\nBut Mr. Street knew the truth about a pair of white mute swans gracefully gliding on the creek. Such swans, he noted, were imported from Europe and have become a vexing bay problem as voracious devourers of underwater grasses needed by crabs and other hard pressed creatures.\n''Fun to look at, but they shouldn't be here,'' said Mr. Street, eyeing his new environment."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Jeff Nelson faced 1,225 batters in five seasons with the Yankees, little more than what Roger Clemens might face in a good year. Nelson's role has been to pitch to a few batters in the seventh and eighth innings, a few times a week.\nBut confined though his job may be, his specialty is necessary in this era of six-inning starters and setup men and closers; Nelson, a right-hander, has been extremely important to the Yankees, particularly in the postseason, when he has generally dominated right-handed hitters. The Yankees attached a value to Nelson and his specialized role -- three years at $9 million -- and with Nelson fielding offers from other teams, there is a distinct possibility that he will sign elsewhere, as there are almost no other free agent right-handers available with Nelson's track record or experience.\nAs he considers other opportunities, the Yankees also are looking for ways to improve: Yankees officials will meet today with Arn Tellem, agent for pitcher Mike Mussina, another free agent, and they will presumably discuss his proposed salary, a seven-year deal for $16 million to $17 million a season.\nSigning Mussina remains the Yankees' top off-season priority. If they cannot sign Mussina -- and they do not appear to be in the running for Mike Hampton -- then the Yankees figure to pursue Manny Ramirez, the slugger who reportedly turned down a seven-year, $119 million offer from the Cleveland Indians. The Yankees are expected to sign outfielder Paul O'Neill in the next day or so and to exercise the option of designated hitter Glenallen Hill.\nWith their $9 million offer to Nelson temporarily off the table, they are looking at alternatives, and there are very few available relievers who could step into Nelson's role seamlessly. The Yankees have expressed interest in the right-hander Turk Wendell, but Wendell's agent is deep into negotiations with the Mets. Jose Mesa, 34, a veteran power pitcher who struck out 84 this year, is available, but he has a checkered history in late innings. He surrendered 89 hits (including 11 homers) and 41 walks in 80 2/3 innings in 2000, amassing a 5.36 earned run average.\nYankees scouts will watch Tom Gordon today in Arizona, to see how his elbow is recovering from surgery; Gordon, a former closer for the Red Sox, pitched just 17 2/3 innings this season, after he went 46 for 47 in save chances in 1999. Julian Tavarez was once a setup man for the Indians, before moving on to San Francisco and Colorado, and now he is a free agent. The Yankees are considering him as a possible No. 4 or No. 5 starting pitcher, rather than as a setup man, after he threw 120 innings for the Rockies last year. Rheal Cormier interests the Yankees, but he is left-handed. There have been inquiries about Mark Petkovsek, who went 4-2 with a 4.22 E.R.A. for the Angels this season, but he allows a lot of hits and generates few strikeouts.\nThe Yankees will explore trades, as well, but there are no perfect replacements for Nelson there, either. The Yankees are apparently comfortable with their last offer to Nelson and do not appear desperate to re-sign him -- perhaps because of his age (he turns 34 later this week), his medical history (elbow trouble in 1998, surgery in 1999) and his occasional mild gripes about the way he was handled by Manager Joe Torre.\nNelson seems to be drawing serious interest from the Philadelphia Phillies, the Baltimore Orioles and the Seattle Mariners, and it is quite possible he can be paid more than what the Yankees are offering. A separation between the Yankees and Nelson could be in the making.\n''We've got to think about the big picture, which is improving the club as a whole,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. ''We hope to have a better club in 2001 than in 2000. Maybe at some positions you're not as good as you were, and in other positions you are better.''\nOf the chance that Nelson may depart, Cashman said: ''I'm confident I'll do whatever I have to do to research and prepare for the possibility.''"},

Pumpkin pie.\nIt's a formula for Thanksgiving dinner, the elements of a meal that suggest a homogeneous America, one with a linear common history and a shared, predictable taste.\nBut that is not at all what America is today. And it is certainly not how Americans really celebrate this holiday.\nNext week, when people sit down to Thanksgiving dinner, an interesting thing will happen. Americans will draw on their own histories along with our nation's to create a meal with an identity all its own.\nAs much as it is the traditional gathering of friends and family and celebration of the harvest, Thanksgiving has also become a way to express who you are and where you came from. In many ways, it is a reflection of what American food is today: a cuisine without barriers, open to influences from everywhere.\nWe asked five families around the country to share with us what they do for the holiday and to cook a preview of the feast they will put on the table next week. Every meal felt firmly like Thanksgiving dinner, and yet not all of them included turkey -- and none of them ended with pumpkin pie.\nWhen the Le family in Huntington Beach, Calif., get together, they will begin with spring rolls and foie gras on toasted baguettes, and finish with persimmons and petits fours, all reminders of places -- Vietnam and France -- that once meant home to them.\nIn Somerville, Mass., Bryan Simmons and Ralph Vetters will celebrate with friends and family over a meal that has evolved over their 18 years together. They are clever, adventurous cooks who refuse to serve turkey -- this year, the main course is crown roast -- but they are careful also to preserve family recipes like black walnut pie and sweet potatoes with lemon.\nThe Harts, Canadians who moved to Phoenix 28 years ago, will feast on an elaborate meal enlivened with the Southwestern flavors they have come to love. They will celebrate with seasonal produce, some picked in their own backyard, and that doesn't mean acorn squash, pumpkin and apples. In their part of the country, it's chayote squash, grapefruit and chilies.\nKathy Starr, a traditional Southern cook in Georgia, will be carefully replicating family recipes that have been passed down through four generations.\nMeanwhile in South Carolina, Nina Liu's main Thanksgiving tradition is avoiding the appearance of having one: for the last 15 years, she hasn't known exactly what will be on her table, or who will be around it, until the day arrives.\nAnd that's what makes the holiday so great. After all, this is America. You're free to create your own traditions."},

The company is ''in the process of producing'' the documents the S.E.C. seeks, the filing said.\nThe company said it did not believe ''that this inquiry by the S.E.C. will have a material adverse effect on the company or its financial statements.'' Stephen E. Hare, the chief financial officer of AMF, declined to comment on the inquiry last night. The company did not mention the investigation in a news release it issued yesterday about its third-quarter earnings. Goldman Sachs is AMF's biggest shareholder, having bought the company and then selling part of it to the public in an initial public offering. AMF's chairman, Richard A. Friedman, is a managing director of Goldman, and Terence M. O'Toole, another managing director, is also a director of AMF.\nIn its filing with the commission, the company said that its restructuring options included a negotiated reduction of its different classes of debt through a Chapter 11 filing in bankruptcy court. Whatever restructuring plan it chooses, it said, is likely to have a ''material adverse effect'' on the ability of its shareholders to recover their investments in the company's stock.\nAMF's stock rose 3 cents yesterday, to 23 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAMF reported that it lost $57.1 million, or 68 cents a share, in the third quarter, down from a loss before extraordinary items of $109.5 million, or $1.43 a share, in the third quarter of 1999. Near the end of that quarter, on Sept. 15, AMF failed to make a scheduled payment on some of its senior debt.\nThe company said yesterday that the missed payment could lead to an acceleration of payments due to creditors, which in turn could lead to ''cross defaults'' on the company's other debt. It said it owed a payment of $12.8 million by Dec. 31 that ''it is unlikely to make.''\nAMF, which operates 527 bowling alleys around the world and also makes bowling and billiards equipment, has been struggling since it began borrowing money to buy bowling alleys just as the Asian financial crisis struck."},
{"headline": null, "content": "THANKSGIVING at the Harts' house in Phoenix begins not with dinner but with breakfast. A breakfast for those with a hearty appetite and a bold palate early in the morning.\n''We always have oysters and bacon and fruit off our trees,'' Patty Hart said. There is coffee and eggnog to drink. The oysters are breaded and fried and served with lemons, also from their trees out back.\nTheir three daughters-in-law have recovered from the initial shock, she said, and have become converts.\nBut breakfast is merely a hint of what is to come later in the day: more oysters, more fruit and a meal filled with creative plays on Southwestern flavors like corn, tomatoes and chilies.\nThe Harts moved to the United States from Canada in 1961. Canada has its own Thanksgiving in October. ''We eat the same foods,'' Ms. Hart said. ''It's exactly like it is here. It just isn't the fun that it is here.''\n''Bland'' is the kindest word Ms. Hart uses to describe the food she grew up on in Winnipeg. The fried-oyster tradition originated there, but in many ways the family's culinary horizons opened up in the United States, particularly when they moved to Phoenix in 1972, so that her husband, Monty, could open a medical practice.\nAll of the Harts cook in some shape or form. One son loves to grill, another son is a chef in San Francisco and a third son in Texas likes to make preserves and sweets.\nAnd Mr. Hart?\n''He makes a good martini,'' Ms. Hart said.\nMs. Hart orchestrates most of the meal, infusing many of the dishes with regional flavors. The others help out. Her son Michael, the chef, brings oysters from the Bay Area and wine from Napa.\n''My basic attitude,'' she said, ''is, I love a traditional dinner. I don't change the turkey part too much, but I do things on the side just to alter it a little bit.''\nIt's a modest assessment. What is actually the most important meal of the day begins in the late afternoon with Champagne, tortilla chips and guacamole, and Malpeque oysters just touched with heat under the broiler and topped with a chilled salsa. It is the only controversial dish. Michael, a raw oyster purist, always rolls his eyes, Ms. Hart said, adding, ''But then he admits they're really good.''\nThe first course is a mildly spicy posole, a hearty stew made with tomatoes, dried corn kernels and chilies. Then comes the turkey, which has butter slipped under the skin and a medium-hot New Mexican chili powder and spices rubbed on top before roasting. With it, she serves a number of condiments: a tart, peppery pear chutney; a jalapeno jelly with bits of the pepper suspended in the clear amber mixture; and a sweet, fresh-tasting roasted corn relish.\n''We like heat,'' she said. But not all of her sons and their wives do. She serves condiments, she said, so that ''the people who don't like a ton of heat can choose what they want to eat.''\nHer side dishes give the feeling of a harvest meal. One, calabacitas, is a mixture of squash, corn, tomatoes and green chili peppers covered with bread crumbs. It is a typical Mexican dish with many variations. Hers is like succotash made into a casserole.\nShe also makes thin slices of chayote squash, a vegetable traced back to the Aztecs and the Maya. Ms. Hart braises it in broth and finishes it with cream and butter. It has a texture much like cucumber, only denser, and cooked this way, has a sweet, creamy flavor.\nMs. Hart decorates her table with candles and sprays of bougainvillea, the brilliant red crepe-papery flower that flourishes in the West.

{"headline": null, "content": "On the southern edge of this city's expanding downtown arts district, on the ground floor of modern 10-story apartment building, stands the Museum of Neon Art, an inconspicuous temple to neon felicitously known as MONA.\nWhatever one calls it, it is a real museum with a bona fide mission. Founded in 1981 by Lili Lakich, an artist, and Richard Jenkins, a teacher, the museum claims a double purpose, exhibiting art objects made with neon and showing vintage neon signs. This is the only institution of its kind, said Kim Koga, the museum's executive director, although a new museum celebrating neon signs will open soon in Las Vegas.\nThe museum's permanent collection comprises roughly 40 large signs and a number of smaller objects. But most of the pieces are displayed only occasionally because the museum occupies just 7,500 square feet.\nAt least 20,000 square feet and much higher ceilings are required for the museum to display many of its most interesting pieces. ''Some of our signs are so big,'' Ms. Koga said, ''we can't even get them through the doors. And we have several signs that are still in donors' backyards because we have no storage space for them.'' As a result, its shows, about nine a year, often feature smaller objects lent by artists and collectors.\nWithin this singular museum, artistic borders are easily crossed. Commercial art (a 13-foot-high RCA Victor sign, for example) lies easily next to abstract work. And near the museum's entrance stand a couple of plasma-physics objects, reminiscent of science-fair projects, that patrons can touch.\nThe museum's most famous holding is the old Brown Derby sign, taken from the famed Hollywood restaurant and gathering place of the stars after years of neglect. It now stands in a display case right outside the museum's galleries, visible to traffic on Olympic Boulevard.\nThough the museum takes an active role in saving neon signs, sometimes rescuing them from the wrecking ball, it is not a preservation organization per se. ''We're interested in historic signs, but we're not a historical society,'' Ms. Koga said.\nIt is generally acknowledged that the neon sign first appeared in the United States in 1923, at a Packard automobile dealership in Los Angeles. Within a decade, this gas-based form of illumination was as much a part of American life as telephones and automobiles. But by the early 1970's, urban decay had reduced many neon signs to rusting hulks, their paint faded and flaking, their bulbs dimmed. In some cases, ordinances were passed requiring their removal.\nThis was when neon's siren song became a cri de coeur for Ms. Lakich. ''I felt an indigenous American art was imperiled,'' she said. ''And I thought only a museum would preserve this important expression of folk art.''\nTo that end, she and Mr. Jenkins established the museum in her own downtown studio. Ms. Lakich recalled falling in love with neon motel signs in her youth while traveling with her family. Later, trained as an artist, she created works with neon. The new museum's first show featured kinetic, neon and electric pieces. From the beginning, signs and noncommercial works were displayed side by side. ''MONA should have been called the Museum of Neon, Electric and Kinetic Art,'' Ms. Lakich said. ''But that wasn't as good an acronym.''\nAfter 12 years in Ms. Lakich's studio, the museum decamped to Universal City Walk, adjacent to Universal Studios. The move was intended to heighten the museum's profile, but the effort proved disastrous. Tourists, having just seen the Red Sea part, had no patience for art.\nTo the rescue came the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. In the wake of the 1992 riots, the agency set about revitalizing downtown, and so in 1995 it was moved back to its old neighborhood and into its present home, where it attracts about 500 visitors each month. (The link with City Walk, however, was not entirely severed; the museum now rents large neon signs to the mall, providing the shopping center with some atmosphere and the museum with a showcase.)\nMs. Lakich left MONA's board in October 1999 but continues to support the museum's mission. It plays a valuable role in honoring otherwise unheralded art, she said. ''The sign industry doesn't value its own work, yet this is an American art form in the way jazz is. It tells a story.''\nMore important, added Ms. Lakich: ''MONA has given artists a place to show their work. It has encouraged them. It has acted as a catalyst.''\nOn Wednesday the museum is to unveil a celebration of automobile culture that includes neon work by the artist Frank Romero and a group show titled ''Carnucopia.'' And in June it will mount its most ambitious effort yet, an exhibit depicting the history of neon art.\nTechnological breakthroughs have broadened the possibilities for all forms of electric art, Ms. Koga said. ''Twenty years ago people wouldn't know how to craft art in neon,'' she said. ''Now they do.''\nFor Ms. Lakich, there is also the issue of novelty. ''This material is unique, and one day these artists will be seen as pioneers,'' she said.\nNothing can detract from neon's chief appeal. ''For centuries, art has been concerned with light,'' she said. ''In neon, the metaphor is real.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "THANKSGIVING for many Americans has become as much about discovering new dishes as it is about celebrating those from the past. To Kathy Starr, 46, it is about tradition. For her, much of the pleasure comes before anyone sits down at the table. Her time in the kitchen is spent remembering her mother and her childhood. By cooking the foods she grew up with in Mississippi, she can bring it all back.\nIn the kitchen, Ms. Starr rarely begins a sentence without the words, ''my mama.'' And once you've watched Ms. Starr sift her flour five times, fry turkey on the stove and bake her mother's sweet potato pie, you understand. ''My kids,'' Ms. Starr said, ''they say, 'Mama, why are you cooking all this?' I refuse to change tradition. If it's going to be two people I'm still going to make the same things.''\nMany of the dishes were perfected over four generations. Ms. Starr's ''mama'' is actually her grandmother, who raised her and taught her to cook on a wood stove. Thanksgiving dinner was started days before and ended not with a meal but a feast.\nMs. Starr, cooking dinner at her son's house in Decatur, begins the day before. First she bakes sweet potato pies, which have a crisp crust and a filling that's lighter than it has any right to be. It's eggy and strongly scented with nutmeg, but as fluffy as chiffon (a quality she attributes to baking powder added to the evaporated milk).\nPecan pies are next. Hers have a dense, jammy filling with pecans that taste as if they had been candied. They are another secret: Ms. Starr shakes them in a bag of flour before adding them to the filling, which keeps them on the top of the pie.\nThen there are two towering layer cakes: coconut with sour cream frosting, and caramel. ''Goodness,'' Ms. Starr said, ''when I put that last cake in the stove, I feel like I can see where I'm going.''\nWith such a large meal, you would think she spent the whole time running among stove, fridge and counter, but Ms. Starr works the way she talks, slowly and steadily. She sits at a table, peeling with a paring knife and mixing things together by holding the bowl to her chest and beating with long slapping strokes.\nAfter the desserts, she moves on to the turkeys. The first one she roasts and cools, then lays in a large bowl and rubs inside and out with beaten egg. Wet and unwieldy, it is then dropped into a bag filled with flour, salt and pepper. She shakes the bird as if it were a chicken thigh in a Baggie. She then lowers it into hot vegetable oil and lard and fries it until it's brown as nutmeg.\nThe second turkey is braised. She cuts an onion like a tulip and stuffs it deep into the turkey's cavity with three stalks of celery and a handful of butter. She sits the bird in a deep pot with the neck and giblets, covers it with chopped celery and onion, fills the pot halfway with water and adds more butter. She covers the pot tightly with foil and braises the turkey until it slackens, its meat falls from the bone, and the liquid turns into a rich broth. She mixes some of the broth with the neck meat, corn bread, white sandwich bread and dried sage to make a thick pudding-like dressing. The rest is thickened with giblets and chopped hard-boiled egg for gravy. Nothing goes to waste.\n''My mama had three secrets to cooking,'' Ms. Starr said. ''The black skillet was one of them. The second was, you had to stay in the kitchen. When you leave, she said, you take the moisture in the pot with you.''\nThe third was simmering. For Thanksgiving, she puts turnip and mustard greens, ham hocks, salt, shortening and sugar in a pot and lets them slowly cook down. She simmers potatoes and eggs for potato salad.\nThere is corn bread, of course, baked ham, cranberry sauce from a can and peas for good luck. No one leaves hungry.\nExcept perhaps Ms. Starr, who does not sit down with everyone. ''I start migrating to the table after everybody has been served,'' she said. After making sure not a single piece of tradition has been neglected.\nSWEET POTATO PIE\nAdapted from Kathy Starr\nTime: 1 hour and 55 minutes\n3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled\n5 tablespoons butter, at room temperature\n3/4 cup sugar\n1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg\n1 large egg\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla\n2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder\n3 tablespoons evaporated milk\nUnbaked pie shell, 9 inches.\n1. Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until very tender, about 45 minutes. Drain well.\n2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add butter to hot potatoes, and mash until smooth. Add sugar, nutmeg, egg and vanilla, mixing well. Combine baking powder with evaporated milk, and stir to blend. Add to mashed potatoes. Whisk mixture until velvety. Mound into pie shell, then spread evenly to edges.\n3. Bake until pie has set and is lightly browned on top, about 55 minutes. Cool to room temperature before serving.\nYield: One 9-inch pie.\nTURNIP AND MUSTARD GREENS WITH HAM HOCKS\nAdapted from Kathy Starr\nTime: 3 hours 15 minutes\nSalt\n2 pounds turnip greens, stems removed\n2 pounds mustard greens, stems removed\n2 to 3 pounds smoked ham hocks\n2 tablespoons vegetable shortening\n3 tablespoons sugar.\n1. In a large pot, bring 3 quarts water to a full boil. Season lightly with salt. Gradually add greens in batches, allowing each batch to wilt before adding the next. Add ham hocks, shortening and sugar, and stir well.\n2. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot partway, and cook at a lively simmer for 3 hours. Stir occasionally. By the end of cooking, there should be little liquid left in pot. Add salt to taste. Remove ham hocks. Pick out ham, and return to pot; discard bones. Serve hot.\nYield: 6 servings."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The sleek Acela Express that Amtrak will roll out on Thursday is supposed to move more than just well-heeled passengers between Washington and Boston; it is supposed to carry the railroad a long way toward self-sufficiency, which Congress has insisted it reach by 2002.\nThe railroad, created in 1971 when Congress fused the failing passenger operations of several freight lines, has enjoyed a small boom recently, with record passenger levels and ticket revenues. It has begun carrying mail and express packages, and makes money by running commuter railroads and doing maintenance for other railroads.\nBut its expenses are rising almost as fast as revenues, and its operating losses have not changed much, ranging from $500 million in 1989 to $579 million in 1999, auditors at the Transportation Department said.\nThe auditors estimated operating losses of $521 million in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Amtrak counts the money differently and said its loss for the most recent fiscal year was $471 million, but acknowledges that it must do better.\nThe railroad has tried recently to spend money to make money, by increasing service instead of cutting it, and by investing in new services and technologies. But the General Accounting Office, the auditing agency of Congress, reported in May that in 1995, Amtrak earned 65 cents for every dollar it spent on operations; last year, that rose to 67 cents.\nThe Acela Express, with a top speed of 150 miles an hour, will cut the New York-to-Washington trip to 2 hours and 45 minutes, from 3 hours on the Metroliner.\nAfter a V.I.P. trip on Thursday, it will begin carrying paying passengers in December, more than a year after originally intended. It is ''one of several critical building blocks that will enable us to achieve self-sufficiency,'' said George Warrington, the railroad president.\n''The concept and market attractiveness of high-speed train operations in densely populated corridors,'' Mr. Warrington said, ''is the model that could and should be transported across this nation.''\nOne of the few profitable parts of Amtrak's operation has been the Northeast Corridor, from here to Boston, which carried 12.9 million people last year.\nIn three years, with 20 new Acela trains, it is supposed to carry 15.9 million, or about 8,200 more passengers a day, making the train competitive with the plane between Boston and New York, and raising the market share for Amtrak between New York and Washington.\nAmtrak would not say just how many air passengers it hopes to attract, and the airlines profess to be unworried. If the railroad wins the 8,200 additional passengers per day, many of them will be traveling between intermediate destinations, like Philadelphia to Stamford, Conn., and the airlines point out that the planes will still be faster.\nDelta Air Ways and US Airways last year carried just under five million people on the Boston-New York, Washington-New York, and Washington-Boston routes.\nTravel between Boston and New York is up sharply on all-electric Acela Regional trains, which make the trip faster because of a $1.6 billion track improvement project, largely done for the Acela Express.\nThe question for Amtrak is, will the added patronage be enough. Amtrak is projecting $300 million in additional revenue by 2003, and $120 million in additional costs.\nThat would close the gap, but the bottom line is becoming more worrisome. The railroad was supposed to be self-supporting after its first two years, but subsidies have now reached $23 billion.\nCongress, frustrated, said in 1997 that Amtrak would have to reach ''operational'' self-sufficiency by December 2002. (The federal government would continue to provide money for capital investments, and also promised some money for unanticipated pension expenses, because of a quirk related to Amtrak's creation.)\nThe Transportation Department's inspector general estimated in September that in 2003, Amtrak's losses would total $351 million more than the federal government would give it, and said that its plan to have revenues equal operating expenses relied on $747 million in ''undefined management actions.''\n''Without major corrective action, Amtrak will not achieve operating self-sufficiency,'' the auditors said.\nAmtrak officials say they have improved productivity in several areas, including maintenance of tracks and telephone reservations, and that more savings are possible. Some cost controls must still be identified, said Arlene Friner, the chief financial officer, but ''it's less than a percent of our annual budget.''\nRaising fares is a poor option; the railroad raised fares stiffly in 1995 and 1996 and lost riders.\nMeanwhile the railroad's capital outlook is ''grave,'' the Transportation Department said. A bill to provide Amtrak with money for high-speed rail expansion has 171 sponsors in the House but has not gone to the floor. If it does not come up in the lame-duck session, Congress could still appropriate money next year. But Amtrak backers point out that one of their strongest supporters is Senator William Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and he was not re-elected.\nThere is also a chance that Congress will not actually unplug Amtrak if it does not reach self-sufficiency, but clearly the Acela and the whole railroad must do well."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Naturally, said Ngo Van Ha, the words ''America'' and ''war'' pop into the mind together. But that belongs to the history books. For him, as for many other Vietnamese, ''talking about America means talking about freedom.''\n''What I mean,'' said Mr. Ha, 38, who sells cosmetics in a tiny shop here, ''is that the way of life is more free. Relationships are not as limited. And of course in terms of politics, you have a multiparty system.''\nWhen President Clinton arrives here on Thursday -- the first American president to visit since the end of the war 25 years ago -- he will find a country that is fascinated by America: its freedom, its energy, its work ethic, its robust economy.\nThere are doubts -- about its freewheeling society and about its overpowering role in the world -- and there are still raw wartime memories.\nBut for a people who have been shut out of the world both by the postwar American economic embargo, which ended six years ago, and by their own suspicious government, the United States seems to shimmer like a vision of their own potential success.\nSometimes they can't contain their enthusiasm. ''America is the best country in the world in many ways,'' said Pham Hien, 44, who owns a camera shop in Hanoi.\nFor Nguyen Thi Hanh Nga, 17, a high-school student in Ho Chi Minh City, ''America is a very modern country, and we want to be modern too.''\nFor Tra Van Luong, 47, who sells snakes for traditional medical potions, ''America is rich! It's rich!''\nIn a score of interviews with ordinary people around the country, few mentioned the long-ago war unless they were asked. But there were criticisms -- fed by past experience, perhaps, but focused on the present -- about what some saw as its domineering foreign policy.\n''America behaves as if it's the head of the family,'' said Le Mai Huong, 23, a recent law school graduate. ''It won't listen to anybody and just does what it wants. It wants to impose its subjective ideas on the rest of the world. They keep talking about human rights but I wonder -- what America did in the war, was that an example of human rights?''\nAnd there were questions over whether America's broad freedoms amount to license. Like their government at this time of social and economic transition, many people voiced caution over how and how much to embrace what they saw as America's no-holds-barred way of life.\n''Maybe things are too free, culturally,'' said Pham Nhu Hung, 27, who works for a freight forwarding company. ''As Asians we shouldn't copy too much of the American way of life, like relations between men and women and between children and their parents. Everything is so loose. I don't get the feeling that personal relationships are as deep and as sentimental as in Vietnam.''\nOr as Quang Bao, 34, an artist, put it: ''You can find everything in America -- the most noble actions and the most inhumane. Americans are capable of anything. They can walk in the street naked if they want! That's really too much.''\nOr as Miss Huong, the law graduate, said: ''I admire the way America protects the rights of its citizens; that is hard to find in many countries. But according to the Vietnamese press I've read, there is a lot of violence, too, and I wonder if American people walk around in fear for their safety.''\nThere is a good deal more personal freedom in Vietnam -- even freedom of speech if not freedom of the press -- than its closed political system might suggest. In a Communist country with a controlled press, few of the people interviewed bothered to recite the party line.\nAnd in a sign of increasing confidence, several people even raised the most sensitive of subjects in this one-party state, praising America's multiparty democracy.\n''Here, there is just one party with one idea and there is no competition possible,'' said Nguyen Van Thanh, 70, a photographer and gallery owner. ''Everyone is obliged to listen and to follow the decisions of the party.''\nFew people sounded much like the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Phan Thuy Thanh, for example, who said last month: ''The sufferings and losses incurred by the Vietnamese people due to the United States war of aggression are very heavy and significant. Resolving the damages left by the war is a burning humanitarian issue.''\nBut Dao Minh Hong, 40, a history professor at Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, did offer an insight into official attitudes toward the United States.\nShe said that she taught American history, beginning with the ''capitalist revolution'' of 1776, and that ''I think in some ways I like America,'' particularly its blending of immigrant cultures.\nIt was after the two world wars that America began to throw its weight around, ''acting so very 'smart' and overbearing,'' Ms. Hong said.\n''Of course, when I teach my students, I also praise America for the way it organizes its society,'' she said. ''It's very advanced. But that shouldn't give it the idea that it has the right to impose its will on everybody else.''\nAs for President Clinton: ''I like Bill Clinton a lot. I think of how young he looked when he became president and how all his hair has turned gray now. I have to say that women really like Bill Clinton.''\nOn the other hand, she said, it was hard to watch him as his White House scandal unfolded.\n''We sympathize with his wife and share her feelings in the awful position she was in,'' she said. ''I think that if I were in her position I would have behaved the same way she did.''\nAdmiration for Mr. Clinton is something the Vietnamese government and its people seem to share unanimously. It was he who lifted the postwar economic embargo in 1994 and opened full diplomatic relations the following year.\n''I consider Clinton to be the American who has done the most to heal Vietnamese-American relations,'' said Nguyen Van Tu, 70, a retired accountant. What is known here as the ''American war'' has left a legacy of north-south divisions that have not yet fully healed. Attitudes toward the United States are sometimes sharply at odds between America's former allies in the south and people in the victorious Communist north.\n''Deep in my heart, I still love America,'' said Le Trung Kim, 55, a southerner, speaking in perfect English. ''I was there, you know. I had the good luck to have military training in San Antonio, Tex. And I have relatives who escaped there -- my cousin, my brother, my half-sister. They're living in California, from Sacramento right down to San Diego.''\nAt the end of the war, he said: ''I lost everything. They put me in jail for two years. While I was in jail, my wife and two daughters were lost at sea trying to get out of here. I would have gone too if I could.''\nNow jobless, Mr. Kim is a freelance letter-writer at the central post office in Ho Chi Minh City, helping people with official forms or translations into English and French.\nIn Ho Chi Minh City -- the former Saigon -- it seems that almost everybody has a relative in the United States, and the stories and family photographs they send back tempt the young generation as well as the old.\n''I dream of going there,'' said Tran Thi Quynh Nhu, 23, a saleswoman in a silk shop who is the daughter of a policeman. ''My friends who live in America say there's more opportunity there. I have relatives there who are quite successful, doctors and engineers.''\nIn Hanoi, on the other hand, Nguyen Thi Van, 70, said she was only now beginning to trust Americans.\n''Before, during the war, I was really afraid of America,'' said Mrs. Van, who sells plastic toys from a basket outside a school. ''I was so afraid of being killed. I'd see a plane coming and I'd run for a shelter as fast as I could.''\nBut these days she sees more and more Americans in town -- tourists and businessmen -- and she said she is gaining a new perspective.\n''Now I see that Americans are human beings just like us,'' Mrs. Van said. ''They also love each other and live together, rich and poor. In the street I smile at them and they smile at me. If they stop to buy something, it's always please and thank you, very polite. I didn't expect that.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "IN the living room of Bryan Simmons and Ralph Vetters there is a small wooden coffee table. For the first few years they lived together, it was also their dining table. If it was inadequate, they didn't seem to notice, entertaining ceaselessly with big bowls of pasta, one-pot stews and salad, and friends huddled around on pillows.\nOver the years, their furniture and cooking repertory expanded, and their desire to entertain never waned. After what Mr. Simmons calls the spaghetti years, he went through his ''high French'' period. The terrines. The aspic. The overgroomed vegetables. Like most ambitious cooks, though, he got over it.\nNow, 18 years later, they have a real dining table and a Viking range, and Mr. Simmons has his own voice in the kitchen.\nTo them, as for many people who entertain often, holiday meals come off as naturally as another dinner party. A dinner party that reveres the holiday without being constrained by it. ''Just as I like to be a little less than rote in the way I decorate my house, that's the way I approach Thanksgiving,'' said Mr. Simmons, a senior vice president for marketing at the Lotus Development Corporation.\nMr. Simmons and Mr. Vetters rarely serve turkey. And yet their meal feels like a proper Thanksgiving, replete with autumn vegetables, family recipes and specialties gathered from local markets.\nMr. Simmons does most of the shopping, treating Somerville, Mass., near Boston, like a small French village. He stops in at a local wine store, where the clerks ask him his menu before making suggestions. He goes to the Italian grocer for sausages and for spiced olives for hors d'oeuvres.\nThen Mr. Simmons and Mr. Vetters cook together. Mr. Vetters, who is in his third year at Harvard Medical School, is calm and methodical in the kitchen, slicing potatoes with precision and cleaning up as he goes. He does the side dishes like roasted parsnips, carrots, potatoes and onions, and a casserole of sweet potatoes and lemon. And Mr. Simmons does the rest, in a fantastic explosion of pots, pans, whisks and bowls.\nThis year, Mr. Simmons is making a crown roast of pork with a stuffing of brandied dried fruit and sausage. He will also bake corn bread with bacon fat in a black iron skillet. It may be the only staple. ''You know how your mother would say, 'Set the table'?'' said Mr. Simmons, who is from Tennessee. ''My mother would say, 'Make the bread.' ''\nDessert is plentiful and Southern. Mr. Simmons likes to serve something with black walnuts and something with sweet potatoes, which could mean a moist sweet potato and chocolate swirl cake with black walnuts, a black walnut pie or black walnut ice cream.\nThere's more: his Aunt Mable's sour cream poundcake. The recipe, like the one for sweet potatoes with lemon, has circulated over the years through both families. ''There is a lot of recipe trading in my family,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''We like to find a new recipe and show it off and share it.''\nSome years, Mr. Simmons and Mr. Vetters go home for a family Thanksgiving in Tennessee or Texas. Sometimes their families come to them, and they mix in friends who have no place to go. Mr. Vetters, who was a labor organizer for Harvard clerical workers before becoming the oldest student in his class, has invited some of his fellow medical students. ''We're sort of uncle types,'' Mr. Simmons said. His brother's family of five will be in Boston, and they plan to stop by for dessert.\n''What will begin the evening is we'll have punch while I'm shucking oysters.'' Mr. Simmons said. Called St. Cecilia punch, it is slightly bitter, slightly sweet, and is made with lemons, brandy, peach brandy and Champagne. It comes from ''Charleston Receipts,'' a 1950 Junior League cookbook. ''You know,'' Mr. Simmons said, with a wink, ''it's for Southern society women who aren't supposed to be trashed but are.''\nEveryone will gather around the old coffee table -- spread with smoked ham pate, a specialty from the South; spiced olives; and local Wellfleet oysters on the half shell -- before moving on to the broadened, matured cuisine in their bright yellow dining room.\nSWEET POTATOES BAKED WITH LEMON\nAdapted from Ralph Vetters\nTime: 1 hour 30 minutes\n6 medium sweet potatoes, rinsed\n2 cups sugar\n1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg\n2 3-inch strips lemon zest\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n6 tablespoons lemon juice.\n1.

{"headline": null, "content": "IT started about 15 years ago. Nina Liu was new in town and invited four or five friends over for Thanksgiving. ''I said, 'Bring anyone you want to bring,' '' she recalled.\nThey did.\n''Somebody brought someone who had gotten out of jail the day before,'' she remembered. ''He just thought everything was wonderful because he had had only white bread and gravy for the past six weeks.''\nPlenty of the others thought it was wonderful, too. Every year since, Ms. Liu, who lives in Charleston, S.C., has invited the same handful of friends, and every year more than a dozen people show up. This year, she is expecting 22.\nHer meal is equally eclectic and unpredictable. ''I always have turkey,'' she said. ''I mean, I have to have turkey but it's usually a small one.'' There is little room for it among all the other dishes. Like her guest list, her menu draws on a few favorites, but mostly relies on whim.\nIt sounds as if it could be a potluck disaster. But odd combinations come naturally to her. Ms. Liu owns an art gallery in a 19th-century row house, and lives in it, too. Sofas and dining room furniture are like weeds in a garden of sculptures and paintings, all of them for sale.\nFor Thanksgiving, she sets her table with plates she made: thick ceramic squares that look like partly rolled-out pastry. Serving dishes are pieces collected from admired potters, with casserole dishes that look like tepees and bowls that are large and roughly textured, the color of earth.\nShe lays the serving plates on a sideboard strewn with large sego palm leaves collected from a tree in the backyard. The centerpiece, a large, cascading arrangement of flowers set in the middle of a wooden mermaid from Oaxaca, Mexico, is always made by her friend, Werner Gross, a florist, who has been coming all 15 years. A sparkling crystal chandelier above the table is the dullest thing in the room.\nMs. Liu does all the cooking. ''She absolutely refuses to let you bring anything,'' said Suzanne Larimer, a friend and stalwart at the holiday, ''unless it comes in a bottle.''\nOn Thanksgiving Day, Ms. Liu gets up at the crack of dawn and begins making pies -- apple-lemon custard and cherry. A flurry of side dishes follow: cranberry-orange relish; peas and snap peas in a creamy dressing; radishes and cucumber tossed with a sweet-and-sour vinaigrette; a cold gingery eggplant salad; potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes baked with parsley; and many others.\nMs. Liu, 61, moved to the United States from Sweden in 1959 when she was a college student. Before Charleston, she lived in Northern California, Michigan, Iowa and Louisiana. Little of this fails to imprint her meal, as does her former husband, who encouraged her to learn about Chinese cooking.\nShe makes a casserole of roughly chopped leeks and a light custard, a dish she grew up with; chayote are stuffed with ham and shrimp, from New Orleans; brussels sprouts are steamed whole and tossed in sesame oil; turnips are grated and tossed with a light soy dressing (her ex-husband's influence); and roasted acorn squash is filled with curried peas. Who knows why. Ms. Liu often composes dishes just for color. She might, for instance, add cilantro to make a dish ''friendlier looking.''\nFriends and strangers -- and their dogs, too -- begin arriving around 4 o'clock. Ms. Liu greets them with Limoncello on ice, Dubonnet or Lillet, nothing so usual as a glass of chardonnay. The guests are soon mingling comfortably, if unexpectedly, like the art. Some years they play a game called People You Don't Have Thanksgiving With Anymore and Why.\n''We made our own family,'' Ms. Liu said, laughing. ''We have our grandparents and uncles and aunts. They don't know who they are; some of the gentlemen are aunts.''\nIn addition to the former convict (a grave robber, by the way), the head of Maine's turkey federation once came. He taught everyone how to do a proper gobble. Last year, a man wandered into the gallery thinking it was open for business.\nOf course, he stayed for dinner.\nLEEK CASSEROLE\nAdapted from Nina Liu\nTime: 1 hour\n10 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices\n7 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces\n4 tablespoons butter\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n2 cups whole milk\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n4 large eggs\n1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan.\n1. Place leeks in a large bowl or a sink filled with water. Toss gently to remove any sand, changing water as necessary. Drain well.\n2. In large skillet over medium-low heat, fry bacon until it just begins to brown. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat in pan. Add leeks, and saute until wilted, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl, and set aside.\n3. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter and gradually whisk in flour to make smooth paste. Slowly whisk in milk until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Whisk in eggs one at a time. Pour sauce over leeks, and toss gently to mix. Transfer to a shallow 2-quart baking dish. Smooth top, and sprinkle with cheese. Bake until set and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.\nYield: 6 to 8 servings.\nMARINATED BRUSSELS SPROUTS\nAdapted from Nina Liu\nTime: 30 minutes, plus 4 hours' refrigeration\n2 1/2 to 3 pounds brussels sprouts\n3 tablespoons soy sauce\n2 tablespoons Asian sesame oil\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n1 tablespoon superfine sugar.\n1. Trim root ends off brussels sprouts, discarding any discolored outer leaves. Cut a shallow ''X'' into root end of each sprout.\n2. Place sprouts in large steamer with an inch or two of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and steam sprouts until just tender and still bright green, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on size. Drain, and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a large bowl.\n3. In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar and sugar. Pour over sprouts, and toss gently to coat well. Cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours, and up to 24 hours. Serve chilled.\nYield: 12 to 16 servings."},
{"headline": null, "content": "BAO-XUYEN LE was standing in her backyard, surrounded by ginger, sugar cane, banana palms and sweet olive. The air was close. Birds were singing and calling. ''Sometimes when I'm here,'' Ms. Le said, ''I feel like I'm back in Vietnam.''\nAnd yet, with the lavender and sorrel at her feet, she might have just as easily felt that she was in France. Or, with the kumquats, blood orange and nasturtium, it could be just where she was, on the Southern California coast, in Huntington Beach.\nMs. Le, 67, and her family have lived in all three places, and their Thanksgiving is a confluence of all that is a part of them. They have turkey with a Vietnamese stuffing, mashed potatoes, French wines and baguettes, and fresh persimmons for dessert, and they speak French to one another.\nRelatives come from near and far. Ms. Le's mother, son and grandson come from the neighborhood, and often her siblings and children make the trip from San Francisco, New York, Paris and Switzerland.\nTheir Thanksgiving dinner is both homey and sophisticated, with clear, gentle flavors and an elegance rarely brought to the meal.\n''I think we've made it to our taste,'' said An-My Le, Ms. Le's daughter, a photographer in New York. ''So that means making things less sweet, and for appetizers having things we like, like foie gras on toast.''\nIt has become her favorite holiday. ''There's no pressure, no presents,'' she said. ''It's just people getting together and good food.''\nMs. Le is the host and the cook. Others pitch in where she allows. Her mother, who is 91, helps assemble spring rolls for hors d'oeuvres. With the nimble hands of a seamstress, she slices pork (which Ms. Le roasts wrapped in bay leaves and seasoned with mushroom powder, garlic and sel de Guerande), mixes it with toasted rice flour and pork skins and then tucks it all into rice paper wrappers with coriander, mint, lettuce and shiso leaves from the garden. The spring rolls are served with a lime dipping sauce, and placed alongside dumplings and foie gras spread on toast.\nMs. Le prepares the turkey. She is a precise, organized cook with a rare knack for restraint. She buys small turkeys and brines them for three days using a recipe by Alice Waters.\nHer stuffing is made of Vietnamese ingredients, and evolved from a stuffing she created for chicken in Vietnam. ''Instead of chestnuts,'' she said, ''you have lotus seeds.'' Rather than bread, she uses dried sweet rice flakes. In place of pork there is ground chicken and giblets. What results is nothing like American stuffing. It is light and moist with little tastes of shallot, giblets, bits of water chestnut and shiitake mushrooms, and a whisper of fish sauce.\nAs the turkey roasts, Ms. Le's daughter or niece bastes it. Giao Nuyen-Quang, her brother from Switzerland, is an orthopedic surgeon, so when the turkey is done, he gets the job of carving.\nTo go with the turkey, Ms. Le makes mashed potatoes, a smooth puree, which she seasons with Asian mushroom powder (''The secret,'' she says), milk, butter and sel de Guerande. For her ''salade,'' she plucks greens and herbs from her garden.\nNow and then a pie shows up -- last year pecan pie was brought for a Swiss aunt who had never tasted it -- but generally the Les stick to lighter sweets. A plate stacked high with persimmons is set on the table, and a platter of petits fours and Vietnamese cakes -- translucent blocks of rice, yam and bean paste in bright green leaf colors and round, dense coconut cakes.\nWhen asked if she made her Vietnamese cakes, Ms. Le paused. ''It's like asking a Parisian if they go to their traiteur or their patisserie!'' she said. Parisians buy their pates and cakes, and so does Ms. Le.\nDinner is informal. ''They eat,'' Ms. Le said, ''but they talk. They talk.'' And the Parisian relatives, they smoke.\nAnd as the hours pass, the wine bottles empty, the baguettes are reduced to crumbs and the persimmons to nothing but peelings.\nThe meal, Ms. Le said, ''is part of our life here.''\nSHIITAKE AND LOTUS SEED STUFFING\nAdapted from Bao-Xuyen Le\nTime: 1 1/2 hours, plus 2 hours for soaking lotus seeds\n3/4 cup dried lotus seeds\n1/2 cup dried sliced shiitake mushrooms\n3 1/2 cups ground chicken (breast and thigh)\nGiblets from turkey or chicken, chopped\n1 cup chopped shallots\n1 cup chopped onion\n3/4 cup chopped water chestnuts\n1 cup dried sweet rice flakes, preferably green\n3 teaspoons mushroom powder\n1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce\nFreshly ground black pepper.\n1. Place lotus seeds in medium bowl with water to cover. Soak 2 hours.\n2. Drain seeds, and transfer to saucepan. Cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer until seeds are slightly firmer than cooked chickpeas, about 1 hour. Drain well, and allow to cool. Split seeds in half, discarding any bitter green shoots in centers. Set aside.\n3. Cover mushrooms with hot water, and allow to soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain well.\n4. In large mixing bowl, combine lotus seeds, mushrooms, chicken, giblets, shallots, onion, water chestnuts, rice flakes and mushroom powder. Mix well with wooden spoon. Season with fish sauce and black pepper to taste.\nYield: 9 cups before baking.\nBRINED ROAST TURKEY\nAdapted from Alice Waters\nTime: 4 hours 15 minutes, plus 72 hours for brining\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons kosher salt\n3/4 cup sugar\n1 carrot, peeled and diced\n1 large onion, peeled and diced\n1/4 cup diced celery\n1 leek, cleaned and diced\n2 bay leaves\n1 tablespoon black peppercorns\n1 tablespoon coriander seeds\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds\n2 star anise\n2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme\n1 12- to 14-pound free-range turkey\nShiitake and lotus seed stuffing, recipe above\n4 tablespoons olive oil or butter.\n1. In 16-quart or larger stockpot, bring 2 gallons water to a boil. Add salt and sugar, and stir until completely dissolved. Turn off heat, and add carrot, onion, celery and leek. Add spices, and refrigerate until cold.\n2. Remove giblets from turkey. Cover and refrigerate liver if using in stuffing. Discard remaining giblets or reserve for another use. Add turkey to stockpot. If necessary, weight with plate so that it stays below brine's surface. Refrigerate 72 hours, then remove from brine and allow to come to room temperature.\n3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Loosely fill turkey at both ends with stuffing, and truss like a chicken.\n4. Place in large roasting pan, and roast until it starts to brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350 degrees, and roast for 12 minutes more per pound, until internal temperature at deepest part of thigh reaches 130 degrees. Baste frequently with olive oil or butter and pan juices. If bird begins to darken too much, cover loosely with foil.\n5. Remove turkey from oven, leave covered and allow to rest 20 minutes before carving and spooning stuffing into serving dish.\nYield: 15 servings."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Last week, I picked up Martha Stewart Living and flirted with the idea of making the turkey with wheatberry, Black Mission fig and pumpkin stuffing.\nBut then I decided to make something else: reservations.\nAs a child, of course, I loved Thanksgiving. My memories are linked most intensely to smells and textures: my blonde grandmother, the clinging scent of Chanel No. 5 in a cloud around her, showing me how to peel an apple so the skin came off in one curled strip. My mother teaching me how to extricate the giblets from inside the slippery, cold turkey.\nAnd there was all the stuff that attends American Thanksgivings: a flotilla of cousins, Shetland pony rides, walks in the country, football games, the whole megillah.\nBut then you grow up. Cousins drift. Grandmothers -- well, there's no way around it -- go to that great Chanel counter in the sky. Parents -- whoops -- marry other people. The Ralph Lauren-ready, afternoon-football-games-and-hot-toddies Thanksgiving can turn positively Fellini-esque.\nSo I have declared something of a Thanksgiving strike, and there is no better way to strike than by not cooking. Who really wants to wade elbow-deep in slippery giblets when you can sigh and wave your hand for a waiter? The refrigerator remains blissfully bare of mysterious mounds of leftovers. There's no sitting through your three-martini uncle's demonstration of Champagne bottle decapitation with his ceremonial Civil War sword; there's a waiter to safely pop the cork.\nDon't get me wrong. I still love to cook. And I do still marvel at the ambitions of the country's first settlers to create a nation that honored freedom -- even if those lofty intentions wound up creating a country in which Richard Hatch, the last man on the ''Survivor'' island, gets to opine about the Electoral College on MSNBC, which he did one morning last week and which signaled to me a swift and imminent end to civilization as we know it. But Thanksgiving has sort of become to me what New Year's Eve is to dating: the expectations are just too high.\nBelieve me, I made some valiant efforts in my 20's. I cooked for friends. I cooked for boyfriends -- even for one who preferred his cranberry sauce straight from the can, still bearing those disturbing ridges along its gelatinous silo -- and for their parents, and tossed around a couple of footballs for auld lang syne. I invested in Le Creuset pans and Wusthof knives and a mammoth turkey-size cutting board. And I experimented: there is definitely a pan-roasted quail with Swiss chard in my past, a polenta gratin and a braised duck with apples. But somewhere along the way, I just lost interest in the culinary struggle.\nWhat did it was the time I went home to Washington, and my mother -- who had become happily laissez-faire about Thanksgiving herself, even more so since she married a man who is wonderful but seems to care as much about food as I care about campaign finance reform -- announced that we weren't cooking that year. Instead, she had made reservations at Red Sage, in the heart of the city. My aunt Caroline, who is an astrologer in some demand in Washington, came with us and to the best of my recollection offered some sort of Hopi incantation before going off to perform an emergency astrological reading on Capitol Hill halfway through the meal.\nWe ordered smoked turkey off a barbecue, which is startlingly delicious and feels really sinfully bad for you. The chef at the time was into exploring Southwestern cooking, so there was interesting hash, and venison, and corn bread. The feeling of family or joyousness or celebration was no less just because there was no nuclear-pink, fructose-heavy cranberry sauce on the table. (Instead, there was a jicama-poblano salsa, I believe.)\nNo pumpkin pie in a cold unyielding crust brought by a relative thinking she was doing a good turn. No Cool Whip! No bad gift Chianti. We dispensed with cleanup duties, had none of that guilty, pointless wrapping up of leftovers.\nEveryone at the table felt a bit like Eloise at the Plaza. And it felt terribly liberating and dangerously thrilling to sign a check on Thanksgiving Day. But thanks, Mom, for picking up the tab."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Failing schools that received extra resources for smaller classes, longer school days and more teacher training had higher scores on standardized tests than similar schools that did not get the same kind of help, according to a study released yesterday by the New York City schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy.\nThe timing of the report seemed calculated to influence contract negotiations under way between the Giuliani administration and the Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers. The union contends that the city is losing teachers to suburbs where salaries are up to 25 percent higher, and is seeking substantial wage increases. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in turn, is seeking productivity increases.\nThe 39 schools in the study were taken over by the chancellor in June 1999 because of their chronically low performance, and were given infusions of $500,000 to $1 million more than their usual budgets. When the so-called extended-time plan was negotiated, some education officials predicted that if it were a success, the teachers' union would use it as an argument for raising teacher salaries citywide. The more than 1,000 teachers who participated got a 15 percent raise for working 40 more minutes a day.\nThe study compared the 39 schools in the program with roughly the same number of schools that were also designated as low-performing by the state but were not taken over by the chancellor or given any extra help.\nIt found that reading scores improved 7 percentage points in the chancellor's schools, 5 points in other failing schools and 6 points citywide; in math, the chancellor's schools gained 3 points, the other failing schools 1.2 points and all schools 1 point.\nAt the same time, the number of students scoring in the lowest of four levels shrank 12.5 percentage points in reading and 9.6 points in math in the chancellor's schools and 10 points in reading and 5 points in math in other schools. Citywide, the bottom level shrank five points in reading and three points in math.\n''This is the kind of information along with other studies that will shape our bargaining demands,'' Mr. Levy said yesterday. ''The purpose of doing these research studies is to become a more data-driven system, so we're not making multibillion-dollar judgments on the basis of seat-of-the-pants guesses.''\nBut Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said the report showed that more time in school is important, but not enough to turn schools around.\n''It is also important,'' he said, ''to have a curriculum that is designed to teach effectively and to have real accountability and oversight,'' which, he contended, privately managed schools do better than public ones.\nBut Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the data was a strong argument against using vouchers to send children to private schools. It showed, she said, that given the proper resources, public schools serving even the most disadvantaged children could be turned around, not one by one, but as a group.\nThe analysis did not try to separate the impact of more productivity -- the extra 40 minutes a day -- from other factors, like a reduction in class size to 20 students from as many as 30, teacher training and new curriculums.\nIn two related reports also released yesterday, Mr. Levy found that teacher certification -- a hot issue in New York City, where 14 percent of teachers were uncertified last year -- has less impact on test scores than a school's ability to get students to show up. These reports looked at all elementary and middle schools, regardless of performance.\nAbsenteeism is a persistent problem in some of the city's poorest and least effective school districts, where 10 percent of the students are habitually absent.\nDemographics alone -- students in poverty, learning English and with behavior and learning problems -- accounted for more than 60 percent of the variation in test scores from school to school.\nAfter taking demographics into account, attendance accounted for 14 percent of the difference in test scores, while teacher certification explained 4.4 percent of the variation in reading scores and 5.4 percent of the variation in math scores.\nBut after controlling for attendance and demographics, the importance of certification dwindled to account for only two points of variation in scores.\nIt was not clear from the report whether the benefits of certification, such as they were, had to do with courses taken in education schools or more years of experience as a teacher. In New York City, certified teachers are more experienced, as a group, than those who are not certified.\nThe report did not attempt to compare similar teachers -- for instance, certified teachers with one year of experience to uncertified teachers with one year of experience.\nAll three reports are published on the Board of Education Web site, www.nycenet.edu/daa/reports."},

{"headline": null, "content": "JIM FASSEL is concerned. You can see that concern in his clenched teeth. You can hear it in his clenched voice. He's concerned not just about the Giants, he's concerned about his job, about whether he'll be back next season to fulfill his one-year contract extension. And he's known all along what his future will depend on.\n''It won't depend so much on the won-lost record,'' Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, had said before the season opened. ''It will be a matter of whether the team is moving in the right direction.''\nWhen they were atop their division even with a loss to the reigning Super Bowl champion Rams, the Giants were moving in the right direction: toward the Super Bowl XXXV playoffs. But with Sunday's embarrassing 31-21 loss to the Detroit Lions that dropped them to 7-4, they are suddenly moving in the wrong direction.\nIf the Giants keep moving in that wrong direction over their last five games beginning Sunday night in Arizona, Fassel won't be back. And he knows it. He also knows he can't wait any longer to do something desperate: energize the special teams that sabotaged Sunday's loss to the Lions, especially the punt-coverage unit.\nWhat the Giants need is somebody like Reyna Thompson, the Giants' coverage specialist on their Super Bowl XXV championship team.\nBut all Fassel can do is use some offensive and defensive starters on the special teams. It's a risk because the danger of injury is always greater on the special teams, which thrive on a kamikaze philosophy. But it's a risk that Fassel must take if he is to save the season. And in the process, save his job.\nMore than anyone else, Fassel will be the one to take the fall if the Giants stagger to a shaky finish.\nEven if they were to make the playoffs and then were rudely eliminated, he would probably be out.\n''I know it's always going to come back to me,'' he said yesterday of his eventual accountability. ''But I think I know this team, and I think I know what they respond to.''\nWhen the coach asked what he thought these Giants did respond to, he said, ''When it gets tough, I think they'll step up.''\nThey better step up in Arizona, where the former Giant quarterback Dave Brown is expected to replace the injured Jake Plummer on the sorry 3-8 Cardinals. But the Giants' offense will be without wide receiver Ike Hilliard, who sustained bruised lungs against the Lions.\nThe following Sunday the Giants will be in Washington where the Redskins and their coach, Norv Turner, figure to be desperate too.\nAfter that, the Giants return home against Pittsburgh, go to Dallas, then finish the season at home on a Saturday against Jacksonville.\n''We've got to play at a high-efficiency level to win a game,'' Fassel said, alluding to mistakes in losses. ''Our turnovers have to be solid.''\nIt's an oversimplification, but turnovers (interceptions and lost fumbles) are the Giants' barometer this season. In each of their seven victories, they had a plus or even takeaway/ giveaway difference. In each of their four defeats, the difference was a minus: minus-1 against the Redskins, minus-3 against the Titans, minus-2 against the Rams, minus-2 against the Lions.\nCheck the turnovers in their five remaining games and you'll probably know where the Giants and Fassel stand. Or fall.\nThe Jets also have a 7-4 record, but after Sunday's 20-3 victory in Miami, Coach Al Groh can take a deep breath. Or at least he can until running back Curtis Martin's damaged back is diagnosed more completely. The Jets can't afford to lose Martin, their indispensable player -- a hard runner, a quick receiver.\nIf the Jets were to lose Martin, they would be in jeopardy in each of their remaining games: the next two Sundays at home with the Bears and the Colts, a trip to Oakland, home again with the Lions, then a season finale in Baltimore on Dec. 24.\nThe Jets, the Colts and the Bills are each 7-4, tied for second place in their division, one game behind the 8-3 Dolphins, who now go on the road to Indianapolis and Buffalo, possibly without quarterback Jay Fiedler. He sustained a pinched nerve in his throwing shoulder when he was sacked by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis.\nThe road to the Super Bowl has always gone through the X-ray room, but sometimes the road to the playoffs goes through there too."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Matching productions of Mozart's three mature Italian comedies -- ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' -- at Glyndebourne here this weekend emphasized the works' differences more than their similarities. The director, Graham Vick, and the designer, Richard Hudson, have placed them all in the same wide white space defined by three slender iron pillars, and there is a link, too, in the mix of 18th-century and 20th-century elements in the costumes. This degree of uniformity, though, only points up the productions' contrary purposes.\nThe ''Figaro'' is immediate and brilliant. Transparent screens, reassembled for each new act, suggest the life of a great house whose multiple rooms and corridors allow for encounters, assignations and eavesdropping. In this environment, people slide slowly and easily into 18th-century dress, maintaining as they do so a harmony of ivory and gray that gives an effervescent vitality to the few spots of color: Cherubino's blue purloined ribbon, the Count's red heels. Most important, the frank sensuality of Figaro and Susanna is not lost as their clothing becomes more formal: rather it gets shared, in an abundant celebration of love and laughter.\n''Don Giovanni'' is another story. Filled with a spill of dirt, the space is now an evil basement, and fancy dress is a signal of corruption. When Donna Elvira enters, she is observed not only by Don Giovanni and Leporello but also by a group of prostitutes and transvestites representing the world she has joined. Don Giovanni has blighted her life as he has those of everyone else he touches. Indeed, he has changed the emotional weather. Even the love between Zerlina and Masetto is mean and graceless. Leporello keeps going as a human being, but only by isolating himself inside a bubble of humor.\nOne moment, when Don Giovanni at his last meal pulls entrails from a dead horse, has won the production notoriety, which is a pity when so much of it is strong and musical. The three superimposed meters of the first-act finale are effectively realized in Ron Howell's choreography, and the ending is powerful, with the men of the chorus rising to present Don Giovanni with his own special hell, all of them doubles of him. The people-hating cynic will find his cold light reflected back at him from all around throughout eternity.\nIn a way, ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' is an even more cynical piece, because there is no moral compass and no divine punishment. Don Alfonso blisters lives as irrevocably as Don Giovanni did, but with urbane detachment. He represents the end of a line, traced through the operas by three linked characters. The Count, in ''Figaro,'' learns to accept the rights of others. Don Giovanni flouts them, whether exultantly or, as in this production, from raging emptiness. But it never flickers across Don Alfonso's fine and speculative mind that such rights exist.\nMr. Vick, while he does not pursue these connections, evidently feels them. He does not want ''Cosi'' to be the way it is, and so he neatly withdraws its sting by offering it as a play within a play. The white space is now a rehearsal room, and the four young people are actors under Don Alfonso's direction. Where warmth flowed generously from the stage in ''Figaro'' and chilliness in ''Don Giovanni,'' here nothing does. Extras with mobile telephones keep reminding the audience that this is only theater. Nothing matters. Mozart's music, which keeps insisting that people are more than windup toys, is -- as much as possible -- sidetracked.\nIn how it was sung and played, though, the music was variously triumphant on all three evenings. The ''Figaro'' cast was youthful and outstanding, led by Christiane Oelze as Susanna, Peter Mattei as Figaro, Marius Kwiecien as the Count, Maria Costanza Nocentini as the Countess and Marina Comparato as Cherubino. All of them worked with their whole bodies, and sang fully as characters, not performers.\nThe ''Cosi'' lovers, forced into the latter role, kept springing out with their physical and vocal agility, which made them affecting. Alexandra von der Weth and Laura Polverelli were the sisters, Paul Austin Kelly and Nathan Gunn their swains, with Alan Opie a seemingly benign Don Alfonso, unaware of his cruelty.\nDon Giovanni, lacking self-awareness for different reasons, was vigorously sung and starkly portrayed by Natale de Carolis. Alessandro Corbelli was the lovable, shrugging Leporello. Nice points were made also by Gwynne Howell as the Commendatore, Bruce Ford as Don Ottavio, Barbara Frittoli as Donna Anna and Sandra Zeltzer as Donna Elvira.\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra, playing with vim and pace, was conducted by Andrew Davis in ''Figaro'' and Louis Langree in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi.'' ''Don Giovanni'' remains in repertory almost to the end of the month. All three productions will, adapting to need, provide Glyndebourne with its central repertory for years to come."},
{"headline": null, "content": "After a young, healthy woman named Lisa Smart died in a Manhattan hospital following a routine gynecological operation, the State Department of Health issued a damning litany of charges.\nDoctors at Beth Israel Medical Center ignored and disparaged warnings from operating room nurses about life-threatening complications, the state said. The equipment used for the surgery was not approved by the hospital, and no one in the operating room knew how to use it -- with the exception of a sales representative, who actually participated in the operation, the state said in its charges against the hospital.\nThe Health Department publicized its findings widely. And ultimately, its conclusions of carelessness and negligence had far-reaching effects: hospital bylaws were rewritten, procedures were tightened and three doctors and a nurse lost their jobs. State legislation to protect patients from bad doctors, spurred by Mrs. Smart's death, was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki this fall.\nBut an examination of the Lisa Smart case by The New York Times three years after her death shows that most of the sensational charges made by the state were found to be either untrue or could not be proven.\nA formal state panel ultimately found that reports of nurses' warnings could not be substantiated or documented. The role of the equipment sales representative was found to be a red herring; his presence in the operating room that day played no role in Mrs. Smart's death, according to a panel appointed by the state's Office of Professional Medical Conduct, which made final judgments on the state's charges against the doctors. The doctors, though found culpable in the death, still faced penalties far less severe than what the state was seeking, based on its review of the evidence.\nAnd in a highly unusual move, the panel chastised the Health Department's investigative unit, the one that had initially issued the scathing report. ''There was much less substance to the department's charges than an initial review would indicate,'' the committee's findings noted. ''As a result, a great amount of time and effort was needlessly expended.'' The state never publicized its ultimate conclusions, reached a year ago.\nSome of the issues raised in Mrs. Smart's death still stir debate. Medical and legal experts see the Smart case as a rare but cautionary tale, particularly as federal and state governments are pushing hospitals and doctors to be more accountable to the public and are pursuing misconduct cases more aggressively.\nThe state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, calls the Smart case a seminal one in the move toward better policing of doctors and hospitals. She has made ferreting out and punishing bad doctors a hallmark of her administration, although Mrs. Smart died before Dr. Novello took over the department.\n''There is no question that there are more high-profile cases in the media than ever before,'' said Anthony Scher, a lawyer who has represented doctors in many of these cases, including Dr. Marc Sklar, one of the doctors in the Smart case. ''I don't know whether the Health Department is generating that or not, but I do know it puts pressure on lawyers and hearing panels to find people guilty.''\nThe Smart case underscores the complexities involved in these investigations. Two state offices investigate the deaths of patients or other serious mistakes; one examines incidents at hospitals, while the other reviews an individual doctor's actions in such cases, and the two often do not work in tandem. Further, the medical opinions of investigators, witnesses and committee members, even when they are all doctors in the same specialty, can diverge profoundly.\n''There is not a set of recipes for how you practice medicine,'' said Roy Nemerson, the deputy counsel for professional medical conduct at the Health Department, the unit that investigates and recommends charges against doctors. ''By and large, the way we prove that, given the facts, the doctor should have done X or Y is through other consulting doctors.'' The findings can be ''controversial,'' he added, ''but that is because medicine is not a precise formula.''\nA Simple Surgery Goes Wrong\nOn Nov. 20, 1997, Mrs. Smart, 30, a financial analyst, went to Beth Israel's outpatient surgery unit, the Phillips Ambulatory Care Center, in Union Square, for a simple, common procedure to remove a painful but benign fibroid tumor from her uterus.\nDr. Robert Klinger, Mrs. Smart's gynecologist, performed the surgery, beginning about 3 p.m. He used a machine known as a hysteroscope to fill Mrs. Smart's uterus with saline solution and then vaporize the tumor. His partner, Dr. Sklar, observed the operation until 4:15 p.m., according to witnesses and hospital documents. A sales representative from Johnson & Johnson, the company that made the hysteroscope, also observed, making technical comments about the machine, a practice common in most hospitals. While both doctors were familiar with the procedure, the machine model was new and used saline, instead of other fluids, for treatment.\nOnce the lights came on, it was clear that Mrs. Smart's body was extremely bloated, overloaded with fluid.\nHer husband, Anderson Smart, a New York City police officer, was told his wife needed to be taken to the hospital's emergency room. Getting her there, though, required calling 911 and waiting for an ambulance -- normal procedure for taking a critically ill patient from the center to the hospital a few blocks away.\nDr. Klinger called Dr. Sklar back at their shared Park Avenue office, crying hysterically, several people involved said. By 8:30 p.m., Mrs. Smart was pronounced dead.\nBeth Israel reported the death to the Health Department. The first investigation was conducted in early 1998 by the state's Bureau of Hospital and Primary Care Services, which quickly slapped the hospital with a violation over the equipment.\nBut the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, the Health Department unit that investigates doctors' actions, assumed a different posture. Its investigators went to the hospital and collected more information.\nWorried that an internal hospital inquiry had been superficial, the investigators then alerted their counterparts in the state's hospital oversight unit to go back and take another look, the state's investigative notes indicate. The state then reopened its investigation, issuing an extensive list of charges against the hospital, including ineffective hospital oversight, violating a patient's rights and improper training of the staff. The state fined the hospital $30,000.\nThe hospital then forbid both doctors, and their partner, Dr. Steven Swersky, who was not involved in the case but had his own problems with the state, to practice there. A nurse involved in the case was dismissed. (Beth Israel officials refused to be interviewed for this article.)\nInvestigators with the Office of Professional Medical Conduct turned over their findings to a committee appointed by the health commissioner that decides whether to proceed to a full-blown hearing. If the evidence requires a hearing, an administrative law judge and a panel of three other people, two of them doctors, decide what action to take against a doctor.\nUnsubstantiated Accusations\nIn the Smart case, one of the state's most incendiary charges against the doctors and the hospital involved two nurses, Janice Robbins and Lillian Cintron, who assisted in the surgery.\nAccording to the state's investigative charges, these nurses noticed that the fluid being pumped into Mrs. Smart's uterus was not draining, and they warned the doctors repeatedly of that condition. The doctors, the report said, ignored them. Ms. Robbins ''stated in a loud voice, 'There is no outflow, where is it going?' '' the report said. ''At one point,'' it continued, ''she said that Dr. Klinger replied, 'All right already, I heard you.' ''\nHowever, during the doctors' hearings with the state committee, none of the witnesses, including other doctors and nurses who attended the surgery, remembered hearing any warnings, according to transcripts and interviews with several people who testified. Even a nurse who stood inches away from Ms. Robbins during the operation testified that she heard nothing, those transcripts indicate.\nNo document in Mrs. Smart's file or elsewhere in hospital records mentioned the warnings, Beth Israel confirmed. A note, obtained by The Times, that was written by the following day's nursing supervisor, described a meeting with the nurses involved in Mrs. Smart's case and makes no mention of warnings to the doctors.\nThe state's final report found: ''The department failed to carry its burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that (the doctors) ignored repeated warnings from the nursing staff.''\nMs. Cintron hung up on a reporter when reached at Beth Israel. Ms. Robbins, who now works at another hospital, said, ''There is no question that I warned them.'' She added that she did try to document her actions but would not elaborate.\nThen, there was the role of the equipment sales representative. In a highly unusual violation, the state agency initially found, the representative, David Myers, operated the controls of the hysteroscope while the doctors performed the operation. His mere presence in the operating room was cited by the state as inappropriate.\nBut after the doctors' formal hearing, the state's disciplinary panel saw things much differently. ''There was absolutely no evidence that he operated or attempted to operate the hysteroscope,'' its report reads. ''The presence, authorized or not, of the salesperson was also seen as not affecting the care rendered.''\nJeffrey Lebow, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman, said in a recent interview, ''We remain convinced that our salesman had nothing to do with her death.''\nFurther, the committee found that the hospital had approved the equipment, and that its technical differences from previous models were not significant enough to require special training. Johnson & Johnson has since removed this equipment from the market to study it for other problems, which it said were unrelated to Mrs. Smart's death, but plans to reissue it soon.\nA Finding of Negligence\nAs for the doctors, the disciplinary panel determined that Drs. Klinger and Sklar were negligent in their care of Mrs. Smart, but not incompetent. Both were ultimately responsible for mismanaging the fluid levels that eventually overloaded her body, the committee found, and in particular chastised Dr. Klinger for failing to accept any blame.\nThe committee concluded that Dr. Sklar's role was minimal, saying he only operated the equipment for about 15 minutes. He was already on probation for problems with the delivery of some babies and some other gynecological procedures, and the committee decided to continue his probation, but ruled out more onerous penalties, to the dismay of the the state's lawyers. The panel ordered all procedures by Dr. Sklar to be supervised for two years.\nThe panel found Dr. Klinger's care to be ''grossly negligent.'' The state suspended his license to practice medicine for two years. Typical of many disciplinary actions against doctors, the panel stayed all but two months of that and put him on probation. The panel, saying it was ''troubled by his refusal to accept any personal responsibility,'' fined him $10,000 and ordered him to serve 500 hours of community service.\nMr. Nemerson, who oversees the state's unit that investigates doctors, said various factors might have resulted in what was a clear and disappointing loss for his lawyers. ''Sometimes there are things we did not know at the time of the investigation,'' he said. The hearing committee has ''the final vote,'' he added. ''That doesn't mean they have the final wisdom.''\nHis division objected vociferously to the dismissal of so many charges, but finally accepted the committee's findings.\nDr. Klinger declined to comment for this article.\nDr. Sklar said: ''During the past two years I was the object of an unfair and politically motivated rush to judgment by both the New York State Department of Health and Beth Israel Medical Center. The initial report issued by the Department of Health contained numerous, inflammatory charges that were completely without any basis in fact. Sadly, the real truth behind the tragic death of Lisa Smart remained buried.''\nA Hospital's Reputation Is Marred\nApart from the doctors, Beth Israel was deeply damaged. Loyal patients began to question the hospital's care openly, and a September 1999 case in which an obstetrician carved his initials into his patient's belly after performing a Caesarean section further marred the hospital's reputation.\nInternally, the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology was devastated by the Smart case, according to dozens of doctors, hospital administrators and other staff members. The highly unexpected nature of Mrs. Smart's death prompted a series of internal peer reviews.\nWhat had happened? How could it have been prevented? Such conferences are secret and sacred to the profession, immune to the inquiries of trial lawyers and blocked to the news media. Several people who attended the meetings detailed difficult discussions which centered on the final hour of Mrs. Smart's life.\nFor example, Dr. Sklar said that when Dr. Klinger had called to tell him about the fluid overload, he advised him to keep Mrs. Smart on a breathing tube until the drugs given to reduce her swelling did their work.\nShortly thereafter, the anesthesiologist, Dr. Gregory Kinsella, opted to take the breathing tube out, because he thought her condition had stabilized, according to statements he made that were contained in the state's original investigative report. (Dr. Kinsella was the senior doctor during the procedure.) A copy of her chart showed that he wrote that she was discharged home.\nMinutes later, Mrs. Smart's condition deteriorated rapidly, and her pulse dropped to 50 beats per minute. Still, Dr. Kinsella did not reinsert the breathing tube until nearly a half-hour after her vital signs declined precipitously, according to her chart and the state's investigative report. At that time, her heart failed. She was then taken to the main hospital, where she died. The decision to remove her breathing tube was debated during the hospital's internal conferences, said some of those in attendance.\nDr. Kinsella's actions were part of the initial state investigation, and the hospital suspended him for a few weeks at that time as it conducted its own inquiry. Because of the notations he made in Mrs. Smart's chart, he was put under supervision for six months, the hospital said.\nDoctors hired by Drs. Sklar and Klinger to review the case criticized Dr. Kinsella's decision, calling it ''inexplicable,'' according to documents prepared for their lawyers. So did Mr. Smart's lawyers, who named Dr. Kinsella in the lawsuit that Beth Israel agreed to settle.\n''Based on the experts that I employed to review hospital records, I was shocked and dismayed that the Department of Health did not pursue Kinsella,'' said Linda Cronin, Mr. Smart's lawyer. Ms. Cronin added that her client was disappointed by the state's ultimate findings in the case.\nDr. Kinsella, by many accounts a very respected anesthesiologist at Beth Israel, declined to comment. Doctors and executives at the hospital said the care Dr. Kinsella gave Mrs. Smart was reviewed and found to be appropriate, but hospital officials refused to confirm that or provide details of their review.\nBeth Israel amended several of its policies and procedures as a result of the Smart case; it now has imposed one of the strictest protocols in the city for monitoring patients' fluids in its operating rooms, and doctors who have been in trouble with the state have a much harder time getting on its staff.\nFallout at the hospital did not end with the dismissals of the doctors. Almost every doctor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at Beth Israel at the time of Lisa Smart's death has left the hospital. The department also lost roughly 30 percent of its business in delivering babies. And Dr. Sklar has not worked as a doctor in over a year, while Dr. Klinger practices at Staten Island University Hospital.\nAnderson Smart, who never set foot again in the Orange County, N.Y., home he had shared with his wife, still works as a New York City police officer and is active in working for state and federal legislation on patients' rights.\nCHRONOLOGY\nInquiry Into a Death\nFollowing is a chronology of the events surrounding a 30-year-old woman's death after routine surgery:\nNOV. 20, 1997 -- Lisa Smart dies after a routine gynecological operation at Beth Israel Medical Center's outpatient surgery center.\nJANUARY 1998 -- The State Department of Health's unit that investigates hospitals, the Bureau of Hospital and Primary Care Services, cites Beth Israel for a minor violation.\nJUNE 1998 -- The Health Department's unit that investigates doctors, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, takes up the case.\nNOVEMBER 1998 -- The Bureau of Hospital and Primary Care Services issues harsh charges and a $30,000 penalty against the hospital.\nNOVEMBER 1998 -- The O.P.M.C. formally charges the doctors with misconduct.\nMARCH-AUGUST 1999 -- Under the auspices of the O.P.M.C., the doctors have a hearing before a committee and an administrative law judge.\nDECEMBER 1999 -- The committee hands down relatively lenient penalties against the doctors.\nOCTOBER 2000 -- Gov.

Mr. Liang, 17, said with wonderment as he moved to a bed in an adjoining room.\nBut there is both a happy and a sad story behind the recent surgery in a small operating room at a community hospital here near Beijing.\nMr. Liang is one of 1.1 million poor Chinese who have had their sight restored through free cataract surgery in the last four years under the Sight First project, sponsored jointly by Lions Clubs International and the China Disabled Persons Federation.\nAs China has opened its economy and developed its own philanthropically minded middle class, such charity projects are increasingly common. That's the happy part.\nThe sad part is that Mr. Liang, who suffers from an inherited condition that can be remedied by simple outpatient surgery, spent so much of his childhood nearly blind, even though the technology to cure him was widely available in China.\nIn Beijing's clinics, 40 miles from Mr. Liang's home, people with enough cash can get top-flight eye surgery for about $500 an eye. But those clinics might as well be on Mars for people like Mr. Liang. Today, medical care in China is almost entirely a matter of cash from individual patients, and there is no public health insurance for the poor.\nTwenty years ago, China boasted the broadest public health system in the world, offering free (if basic) health care to all. But the country's shift to a market economy has upended that balance, allowing entry of more advanced medical techniques but also making even simple procedures widely unaffordable.\nThe World Health Organization now rates China last among developing countries in terms of equal access to medical care. (The United States is last among developed countries.)\nYang Liqun, a government researcher who has studied social services on the outskirts of Beijing, found that only 9.9 percent of people in Shunyi County had any kind of medical coverage. ''During the process of reform, the old system of cooperative medical care has suffered devastating damage,'' he wrote in the journal Beijing Social Sciences.\nAnd so, when Mr. Liang's vision began clouding over eight years ago, he did what rural Chinese often do when they fall ill: he endured. As cataracts from a congenital condition marched over first his left eye, then his right, he tried his best to help out in the family fields and was determined to keep going to school.\nLast year, while in the ninth grade, he dropped out of school because he could no longer see his books. But treatment was not an option.\n''I never visited a doctor for this until Oct. 1 this year,'' he said from his bed in the recovery room, referring to the day health workers came to his village looking for patients who might benefit from the Sight First project. ''I knew it could be corrected, but we had no money to see a doctor, much less have surgery. So what was the point?''\nIt is a jarring admission in a country once so committed to egalitarian health care. But during the last decade, as central government financing for hospitals has plummeted, free medical care has given way to hefty patient charges for doctors' visits, surgery and tests.\nIn China today, treatment is often an economic rather than a medical decision. And charitable donations, often organized by the state, are unable to cover the huge tab that the government has dropped. Cataract surgery, done on an outpatient basis, costs about $50 at the township hospital in Shunyi, about half as much as in hospitals in Beijing.\nThat is still two to three months' earnings for poor families, money that is in any case consumed by day-to-day subsistence. Mr. Liang's mother also suffers from cataracts and his father lost his arms in an industrial accident. So he lives with his grandfather, who has taken care of him as he has become progressively disabled.\nThe Lions Clubs program has helped reduce the cost and improve the quality of cataract surgery in China. The group has trained 4,000 doctors in surgical techniques, many in outlying areas, and it has donated some of the latest equipment to diagnose and treat eye disease.\nThe project helped a factory in Suzhou to gear up to make the little plastic lenses that are the key to the operation's success. Before late 1998, when the plant started production, Chinese-made lenses were of very low quality and imported ones were prohibitively expensive.\nBut the main contribution at this hospital is, plain and simple, financial. The program pays for the surgery for patients who cannot afford it, and covers the costs of hospitals that say they cannot afford to treat patients free.\n''Even though the technology exists here, these people just don't have the money,'' Dr. Jiang said.\nZhang Bofang, a farmer from nearby Huairou who also had surgery in Shunyi recently, said his vision started ''clouding over'' in 1997. For the last year he has been unable to tend his field or even walk down the street alone.\nWith his children grown and gone, his wife tended the family's wheat, peanut and corn fields alone. ''It has really been a struggle,'' said Mr. Zhang, wrapped in the tattered brown sweater he wore for his surgery. ''I went to the hospital in Huairou to try to get treatment a few times, but I didn't have the money, so I just had to go home.\n''This time it was free. Now I can start working again.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Like characters in a comic opera, the presidents-almost-elect have passed much of the last two weeks making cameo appearances in the theater of public opinion. As lawyers skirmished and handlers cranked scenery in the background, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush skittered from stage left to stage right, finally stalling in the mediagenic, vaguely neutral center.\nWith no conclusive vote count, the candidates have been forced to perform their roles symbolically, drawing from a repertory of archetypes and presidential precedents. And both have made numerous costume changes appropriate to their roles. In brief and highly scripted public appearances, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush turned themselves out, respectively, as the cologne ad jock and the laconic rancher, and then both played chieftains of the body politic. They have drawn on symbolic legacies as varied as those of Presidents George Bush, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as Jett Rink, the iconoclastic oilman memorably portrayed by James Dean in ''Giant.''\n''Style has become the message and is used now to indicate the psychological, intellectual and emotional positioning of a candidate,'' said Howard Rubenstein, the well-connected New York public relations man with political clients. ''The handlers of the two candidates probably spent hours figuring out what they should be wearing throughout the delivery of their spin.''\nNeither camp is in any hurry to confirm that the candidates have received sartorial direction. Yet it is no surprise in a season of microscopically dissected gesture and dangling chads that their clothes have had a lot to say. When Governor Bush goes to the voting booth dressed in a windbreaker and tieless shirt (the vice president chose a suit) or is photographed in a barn jacket clearing brush on his 1,500-acre Texas ranch, he is allying himself symbolically with the populism of Ronald Reagan. ''Ronald Reagan cutting timber looked great,'' said Alan Flusser, the men's wear designer and author of ''Style and the Man'' (HarperCollins, 1986). ''He looked natural doing it. But these guys are products of image makers, and the images fall short.''\nJust as implausible were Mr. Gore's dressed-down forays into public, meant to telegraph a ''What, me worry?'' demeanor against a backdrop of increasingly heated legal wrangling. Mr. Gore, in his first post-Election Day showing, in Nashville, emerged in sweats to go jogging with his daughters. Paradoxically, this had the effect of making him seem more self-conscious, less at ease, than the world's best-known politician runner, Bill Clinton, who typically takes to the road in shorts.\nOn the following day, Nov. 10, as Mr. Bush talked from the governor's mansion in Austin about assembling a cabinet, the vice president compounded his image blunder by staging an unconvincing touch football scrimmage (time: 15 minutes) with his son in a Washington backyard, wearing jeans and a dark, cable-knit turtleneck sweater that accentuated Mr. Gore's attractive pectoral mass. Fighting the perception that he is the consummate nerd, Mr. Gore very likely intended to come off as comfortable in his second skin. But few people choose such an outfit for football.\nThe two days of playing the athlete may have been one day too many, given how well schooled most Americans have become in assessing spin. As Maureen Connelly, a partner in Connelly & McLaughlin, bipartisan political consultants, said: ''You don't want to look as though you're hunkered down behind closed doors. But after a day of jogging, it might have been smarter if Gore had had the photo op of him going back to work as vice president.''\nGovernor Bush's image, lacking the gloss of Hollywood authenticity Mr. Reagan brought to his even more improbable down-home gestures, has a tendency to betray itself, said Anne Hollander, author of ''Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress'' (Knopf, 1994). ''Bush looking casual on his ranch appears as if he's the master of untold acres,'' Ms. Hollander said. ''Since it's known that he comes from a serious political dynasty, it makes him look imperial in a way that's analogous to an English gentleman out on his estate in riding clothes. It looks as if he owns Texas rather than governs it.'' Despite his best efforts, Mr. Bush's air of entitlement keeps seeping into the frame.\nIf Mr. Bush's goal was to convey a sense of authority unencumbered by stress, the effect was undercut by his joint appearance at the ranch with his running mate, Dick Cheney, who chose not a barn jacket, jeans, work boots and a Stetson, like his potential future boss, but a buttoned suit, rendered casual only by the lack of a tie. ''Bush was L. L. Bean, and Cheney was Brooks Brothers,'' observed Arianna Huffington, the author and political pundit. ''What would it have taken for Cheney to unbutton that jacket?'' The juxtaposition, Ms. Huffington said, reinforced the unflattering notion that Mr. Bush is dependent on real statesmen grown-ups to carry his load.\nOver the weekend, on the eve of the Florida Supreme Court's decision on the fate of recounts, Mr. Gore jogged for the cameras again, this time looking almost up to date in black leggings and a sleeveless fleece jacket. In some way, Mr. Gore has had to rely more heavily on play clothes to convey unforced masculinity because he lacks a rustic playground to do the job. Historically, the images of presidents vacationing at private compounds -- John. F. Kennedy in Hyannisport, Mr. Reagan in Santa Barbara, President Bush fishing off Kennebunkport -- worked in an effective, if counterintuitive, way. Far from seeming like remote and privileged dilettante sportsmen, they all looked robust and impossibly assured.\nMr. Gore's other efforts at seeming casual included wearing a V-neck pullover on Veterans Day weekend to see the movie ''Men of Honor'' and a loose blazer over a knit crewneck for dinner at a Mexican restaurant with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah. Mr. Gore's attempts to transform himself into a casual-Friday kind of guy may also have backfired, Mr. Flusser said, sending an unintended signal. ''The clothes seemed to say, 'Tell me what to wear until I get to be president,' '' Mr. Flusser said. What they failed to do was to make Mr. Gore look relaxed, anymore than Richard M. Nixon did taking his notorious beach stroll wearing business shoes.\nPoliticians seen in leisure clothes, said Wayne Koestenbaum, author of ''Cleavage: Essays on Sex, Stars and Aesthetics'' (Ballantine, 2000), always run the risk of ''seeming fake and arrogant.'' Common folk ''wear play clothes because we're not being seen,'' Mr. Koestenbaum said. ''To wear play clothes to be seen is at the level of a charade. There's a strong sense that the ideology is as imperial as that of a suit.''\nBy the end of last week, the beleaguered suit -- imperial emblem or indispensable work tool -- had made its way back into the wardrobes of both potential presidents, who were less focused now on looking laid back and genial than unambiguously telegraphing presidential gravity. The vice president put on a three-button suit with a white shirt and tie for a press conference at the White House on Nov. 13 and again for his national television address two days later, which prompted a counteraddress from Mr. Bush. ''At a time when the American public could have suspected we were having a constitutional crisis, that's when Gore went back to the suit,'' said Jefrey Pollock, a pollster with the Democratic Global Strategy Group in Washington.\nIn all, Mr. Bush made fewer appearances in suits (he favors a more formal and slightly dowdier, two-button style) than his rival. One unexpected disadvantage of this choice is that the governor, in a polo shirt, looks nearly as old as his father. Conversely, he looks rejuvenated in a suit. ''A suit is obviously a more youthful costume,'' Ms. Hollander said. ''The female sex learned all this a long time ago from Chanel.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "The Sony Corporation said today that it was preparing to offer a tracking stock to investors to highlight the corporate value of its wholly owned Internet service provider, the Sony Communication Network Corporation.\nThe move will make Sony the first Japanese company to issue a tracking stock, and it is intended to permit Sony to raise funds for its entire consumer electronics and media group while keeping a firm grip on its fast-growing Internet business.\n''We think that this will reveal the corporate value of the subsidiary while raising the shareholder value of the group,'' Sony's chief executive, Nobuyuki Idei, said at a news conference.\nBefore Sony can issue a tracking stock, however, shareholders must approve the plan at an extraordinary meeting next January. In addition, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the government must revise their regulations to allow such shares. Tracking stocks are currently not authorized in Japan, but Sony officials said they were confident that the government would make the rules changes necessary for its plan\nA tracking stock would let investors value Sony's Internet service provider, So-net, separately from the rest of the company, which has had a decline of 44 percent in its share value this year. Investors in the tracking stock would not, however, own a share of the subsidiary, as they would with a conventional stock; Sony will continue to own the business.\nSeveral American companies have used tracking stocks to tap investor interest in technology stocks. AT&T issued one for its AT&T wireless unit, for example, and General Motors did the same for its Hughes Electronics subsidiary.\nUnder Sony's proposal, owners of the tracking stock are entitled to the same dividend that Sony Communication Network pays to its parent and to the same voting rights that accrue to shareholders of the parent company. But the investors have no direct claim on the assets of the Internet company should the parent company fall into a financial crisis.\nThe Internet subsidiary, which says it has 1.47 million subscribers, is strategically significant to Sony, executives said, so the company elected to offer stock without ceding management control to outside investors.\nThe announcement did nothing to reverse the slide in Sony's stock. In Tokyo trading, Sony shares fell 1.3 percent, to close at a 52-week low of 8,120 yen, or about $73.69.\nSome critics said that the tracking stock would not necessarily help the existing shareholders because it might divide the market for Sony stock, making it more difficult to trade existing shares.\nInvestors who own Sony stock because they are interested in the Internet business do not need to hold the parent stock anymore, said Masaaki Abe, chief investment officer of Pictet Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. As an investor, he said, ''it would be financially inefficient to hold both stocks.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "In a quiet village on the outskirts of Zurich, a genetically engineered strain of rice that its creator says could save millions of children's lives is locked up in a grenade-proof greenhouse as if it were the Frankenstein monster that some critics contend it is. Unlike any other rice on earth, this so-called golden rice produces beta carotene in its seeds, thanks to genetic instructions that scientists added to the rice from a daffodil, pea, bacterium and virus.\nBeta carotene is an important source of vitamin A, which is crucial for healthy vision and resistance to disease. The body breaks beta carotene molecules into two vitamin A molecules, also known as retinol. People get beta carotene from fresh vegetables, like carrots, and get vitamin A directly from milk, butter, cheese, liver and cod liver oil.\nBut the World Health Organization estimates that 124 million children do not get enough vitamin A. Most of these children live in parts of the world where rice is not only the main staple but is often the only food available during the dry season, and infants are often weaned on rice gruel alone. Vitamin A deficiency causes about half a million children to go blind every year and makes many more vulnerable to diseases that cause diarrhea. One million to two million children die each year for lack of vitamin A.\nLike a latter-day Johnny Appleseed, Dr. Ingo Potrykus, the German inventor of golden rice, would like to send his seeds to poor people around the world at no charge. ''I would like to send a year ago,'' he said, holding out a handful of seeds stored in a locked refrigerator at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. ''There are 3,500 children dying every day. I think we should not delay one day.''\nBut golden rice has remained under lock and key since it was created more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Dr. Potrykus has struggled to free it from a complicated web of more than 70 patents and legal agreements covering items as diverse as DNA sequences and the techniques he and his colleagues used to insert new genes in the rice. He is also racing against an effort to pass legislation that could prohibit the export of genetically modified organisms from Switzerland.\nDr. Potrykus hopes to be able to send out the seeds before the end of this year under an agreement he worked out with Zeneca Agrichemicals, which has patents on some of the crucial genetic instructions used to make the rice.\nThe deal was brokered by Greenovation, a small German company that specializes in licensing academic discoveries in biotechnology. Greenovation licensed golden rice from Dr. Potrykus and Dr. Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg in Germany, who collaborated on the invention.\nGreenovation then licensed golden rice to Zeneca Agrichemicals, which last week merged with the agricultural divisions of Novartis to form a new company called Syngenta, now the largest agricultural biotechnology company in the world.\nThe company plans to market golden rice in developed countries like the United States as an enriched crop containing antioxidants, which are believed to reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and macular degeneration, an eye disease that leads to blindness.\nIn return, Zeneca Agrichemicals agreed to secure rights to other patents covering golden rice and grant the inventors a license to give golden rice away to international research institutes that are working on developing new varieties of rice in places like India and the Philippines.\nThe genetically engineered rice will be crossed with local varieties using traditional breeding methods, and health and safety tests will be conducted.\nIf everything goes well, within two to three years, golden rice varieties will be made available free to farmers earning less than $10,000 a year from the crop, a figure far exceeding the average income of poor farmers.\nFarmers will also be able to save seeds from their crop for future plantings because rice is a self-pollinating plant that breeds true year after year.\nDr. Potrykus held firm to those conditions through what he described as tough negotiations. But in some ways, the negotiations were made easier because the commercial potential for golden rice is expected to be limited, while the potential humanitarian benefits are great.\nThe inventors will earn a royalty on any profits from the niche market for health foods in places like the United States, said Dr. Adrian Dubock, who negotiated the deal on behalf of Zeneca. And the company agreed to provide Dr. Potrykus with a stipend and cover his expenses for the free distribution of the rice to researchers in developing countries. But nobody will get rich from golden rice, Dr. Dubock said.\nThe free distribution of golden rice seeds and genetic materials will be guided by a humanitarian advisory board consisting of the inventors, Dr. Dubock, representatives from the countries where golden rice will be grown, and Dr. Gary Tonniessen of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, which supported the golden rice research.\nGolden rice could serve as a model for arrangements to share proprietary biotechnology where it is needed most, predicted Dr. Tonniessen, who oversees grants to improve food supplies and nutrition worldwide.\nThe foundation is talking with international agricultural research centers, biotechnology companies and the World Bank about creating a nonprofit holding company that would make such discoveries freely available for humanitarian purposes.\n''Golden rice is just one crop and one trait,'' Dr. Tonniessen said. ''The potential to improve the nutritional content of many crops in many ways is now technically feasible.''\nDr. Tonniessen said the idea for golden rice came from the field in developing nations. He once asked plant breeders at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines what they would choose if they could have genetic engineers insert any gene in rice.\nThe answer was a gene to make rice seeds produce the yellow pigment beta carotene, a trait they had not found in any rice variety and therefore could not propagate by traditional cross breeding. Although beta carotene has no taste, researchers are concerned that consumers in Asia might not like the yellow color because whiteness is highly valued in rice. Still, they hope people will feed it to their children.\nThe key to producing golden rice came from a scientific collaboration that began at a brainstorming session sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, where Dr. Potrykus met Dr. Beyer, who had figured out how beta carotene was produced in daffodils by isolating the biochemical steps that make the flower yellow.\nIn 1993, the two scientists' laboratories began working together to put the three essential genes from a daffodil into rice. But one of the genes did not work. Over the years, they jury-rigged a combination of genetic instructions from a daffodil, pea, bacterium and a virus to make the beta carotene molecule. They still had trouble getting the genes to work together after shooting them one at a time into rice embryos. Finally, last year a researcher in Dr. Potrykus's lab, Dr. Xudong Ye, tried using a bacterium to ferry the instructions in all at once. It worked.\nFrom the outside, golden rice plants look just like other rice plants. It is only when the seeds are hulled and polished to remove the oily outer coating, which is usually done to protect rice from spoiling, that one can see why Dr. Potrykus calls it golden rice. The seeds glow with the yellow color of beta carotene. Golden rice is a dream come true for Dr. Potrykus, and he is noticeably relaxed among the plants in his greenhouse. ''It's a very beautiful plant,'' he said, stroking the graceful green leaves and cascading pearly seed heads.\nDr. Potrykus, 66, has spent his entire scientific career learning how to transform rice. His ultimate goal was to redeem genetic engineering by proving that it could contribute to solving malnutrition, which he sees as the biggest problem in the world. This calling has roots in his childhood, when he was an 11-year-old refugee from eastern Germany after World War II. His father, a doctor, died in the last days of the war. He and his brothers had to beg, steal and scrounge for food.\n''I have experienced myself what it means to be hungry,'' Dr. Potrykus said. And as long as the potential of golden rice remains locked up here in Switzerland, he remains palpably angry and frustrated.\nIn the past decade, genetic engineering has become controversial, as some consumers raise concerns about the potential health and environmental effects of what they call ''Frankenfoods.'' Dr. Vandana Shiva, a prominent opponent of genetic engineering in India, has argued that golden rice is being ''used as a Trojan horse to push genetically engineered crops and foods.''\nGolden rice has become a high-profile target partly because it is being heavily promoted by the agricultural biotechnology industry as the first genetically modified crop to benefit consumers rather than just farmers and agribusiness.\nAnd for better or worse, Dr. Potrykus has become a symbol. He headed the largest scientific research group at Switzerland's top technical university, where he directed 64 researchers investigating ways to improve nutrients and disease resistance in basic food crops. Although he enjoyed the formal respect that accrues to ''Herr Professor,'' the highest honorific in the German speaking university, Dr. Potrykus found himself being put on the spot in increasingly unruly public debates. At one point, he said, he feared for his safety when hundreds of students shouted him down in a lecture.\nNothing has ever happened to Dr. Potrykus or the greenhouse that he built to isolate his experiments from the environment and any foreseeable attack. But by the time he and his colleagues finally succeeded in making rice produce beta carotene last year, after a decade of setbacks, Dr. Potrykus had reached the mandatory retirement age. And Dr. Potrykus said his wife wanted nothing more than for him to ''stop being engaged and start a peaceful life.''\nThey live in a small village more than an hour's drive from Zurich, but even there his wife feels unsafe. ''If the genetic engineer is in the public opinion the devil,'' Dr. Potrykus said, ''you cannot feel happy wherever you are.''\nDr. Potrykus said he would like to retire and pursue their shared passion for chasing rare bird sightings around Europe for a videotape atlas he is compiling. As long as his mission remains unfulfilled, however, bird-watching must remain a hobby.\nSo Dr. Potrykus continues to work from an office in his home, responding to criticisms on the Internet and finalizing plans for distributing golden rice. And although his lab has been dismantled, he has re-enrolled at the institute as a postdoctoral student so he can continue tinkering with rice.\nA colleague is sharing a desk with him. And he is working with the only two members of his team remaining at the institute to try to increase the amount of iron in rice in order to combat anemia, another scourge of people who subsist on a diet of rice and little else. Anemia affects about two billion people, especially weakening children and pregnant women.\nDr. Potrykus said golden rice had received considerable attention, but he considers boosting iron in rice to be even more important. ''The potential for this technology is immense,'' he said, ''but only if it's really used and applied to practical problems.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "The war for Quaker Oats can be summed up in one word: Gatorade.\nThe Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo have both been in talks to acquire Quaker Oats because it would mean winning Gatorade, one of the world's fastest-growing beverages, with more than $1.8 billion in sales a year ago.\nBut what would such a deal mean for the rest of Quaker, which is a nearly $5 billion company? Named after a cereal that traces its roots to the 19th century, Quaker Oats also makes Cap'n Crunch cereal, Quaker Oatmeal, Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima pancake products.\nYet no one on Wall Street believes Coke or Pepsi is interested in a white-haired man dressed in a Quaker outfit or a jolly sea captain wearing epaulets and pitching crunchy cereals for kids.\n''Let's just say it's not why these guys are bidding for Quaker Oats,'' says Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.\nCoca-Cola confirmed today that it was in talks to acquire Quaker. Earlier, Pepsi made a $14.8 billion offer to buy Quaker, which turned down the bid as too low.\nThe conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that once Quaker Oats is acquired by a giant beverage maker and Gatorade is captured, the rest of its food holdings will be disposed of.\nNot immediately, though, because Quaker Oats, which is based in Chicago, would probably be acquired in an all-stock transaction that would prevent it from selling those assets for two years. After that period, Wall Street analysts predict, Quaker's food assets -- which they now estimate to be worth $4.5 billion to $5 billion -- would go on the block. Among the potential bidders: major food makers, like Kraft, a division of Philip Morris; Kellogg; General Mills; Nestle; and Unilever.\n''I think these brands will find new homes,'' says John McMillin, a food analyst at Prudential Securities. ''And the crown jewel of the group would be hot cereals.''\nBut do not expect another blockbuster deal. Without Gatorade, most analysts say Quaker Oats is just an above-average food company.\nYet if bidders come, hot cereals may be an area of great interest. Quaker has a 60 percent share of the United States market, with Quaker Oats and Quaker Instant Oatmeal.\nAnalysts say Kraft, which owns Post cereals, could bid for Quaker's hot and cold cereals, which had sales of about $1 billion in 1999, in the hopes of growing into a stronger competitor to the cereal giants Kellogg's and General Mills. But antitrust questions may prevent Kellogg or General Mills from bidding.\nOne problem, however, is that cereals have fallen out of favor, which is partly why Kellogg has moved into the snack business by acquiring Keebler, and General Mills has diversified by acquiring Pillsbury. Quaker saw the writing on the wall, analysts say.\n''Food accounts for 60 percent of their sales but only about 40 percent of their value,'' said David Nelson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''It's a business in declining categories and it's undersized. ''\nStill, Quaker's snack products could be attractive to other food makers. The company has had strong growth in the sales of its chewy granola bars, and Gatorade energy bars. If PepsiCo comes back with another bid for Quaker, analysts say, they may decide to keep some food brands; if Coca-Cola wins the bidding war, that outcome is less likely.\nAnalysts are also not ruling out the possibility that other companies may enter the bidding for Quaker Oats, thereby altering the dynamic of whether Gatorade is split off from Quaker's other food products.\nIf there is a separation, analysts say, Quaker's Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima brands are less attractive, even though they have strong brand recognition.\nOf course, if Quaker's non-Gatorade food brands were to be auctioned off right now, analysts say, the company would not necessarily get top dollar. Most of the major food makers are already highly leveraged after two years of blockbuster mergers that include Bestfoods and Unilever and Kraft and Nabisco.\nBesides, the experts say, food companies today are operating with relatively weak stocks as merger currencies because of several years of lackluster profit growth. Which is probably why Quaker put itself up for sale. The company's growth engine was Gatorade, and it was slowly evolving into a powerhouse beverage company with an average food company weighing it down.\nSo when the prospect of a merger with another big food maker grew increasingly unlikely, the company decided that rather than survive as a diversified food company too small to really compete against the biggest food maker, it would seek bids from major beverage companies eager to own Gatorade.\nSeveral analysts, however, said the company's non-Gatorade units had performed strongly in the last year, and cost-cutting efforts helped bolster the stock. But Quaker simply was not big enough to go it alone.\n''The long and short of it is: Is Quaker's food business strong enough to go it alone? I'm not sure,'' said Mr. McMillin at Prudential.\nSo with today's announcement that Coca-Cola is in talks to acquire Quaker Oats, it appears increasingly likely that a company that began selling oats in the Midwest is now about to be dismantled.\nQuaker Oats once tried to diversify into toys, buying the Fisher Price Company. The company also made pet foods (Kibbles 'n' Bits), and even bought Snapple, before selling it at a huge loss in 1997. Now, a relatively small acquisition it made in 1983, of Stokely-Van Camp, the maker of pork and beans, vegetable oils and Gatorade, has defined its future.\nIf Coke, whose stock fell $4.94, to $56.56 today, comes away with Quaker, it will simply have to manage those traditional food assets for a few years. And Mr. Nelson at Credit Suisse First Boston says it will not hurt that much. ''For Coke, it's not strategic,'' he said, in light of what a small part of overall sales it would be."},
{"headline": null, "content": "At sunrise here, thin layers of mist blanket vast expanses of grass as hundreds of elk emerge from the mountainside evergreens to graze, the valley echoing with their bugling calls. Bright yellow aspen light up the landscape, as pristine as it has ever been.\nAnyway, that's the way it looks.\nBut though this landscape is entrancing, much of it was shaped by the hand of man. And therein lies a problem for the United States government, which bought the land in July and now must decide how to manage it.\nThe grass is here because until recently the land was used for cattle ranching. The aspen are here because they have gradually colonized areas where spruce and pine were removed in clear-cut logging operations.\nThe region's elk had been wiped out by hunters by the end of the 19th century; the more than 5,000 here today are the descendants of the 49 animals transplanted from the Yellowstone area in 1947 and another 58 that arrived from the same place in 1968.\nEven the landscape itself is relatively new, in geological terms. This bowl-like basin, 15 miles wide at its widest, is the collapsed dome, or caldera, of a volcano that last erupted about 1.2 million years ago in the second of two cataclysmic explosions that spewed more than 16 times as much material as Mount St. Helens.\nLike other dormant volcanoes, Valles (pronounced VAH-yay) Caldera has hot springs, gas vents and other features, especially secondary or resurgent domes that rose after the caldera's collapse; geologists regard the ones occupying much of the Valles Caldera as classic examples of this geological phenomenon. The caldera itself has become a model for research on volcanic processes.\nIn fact, according to the Forest Service, geologists have learned so much from the study of the Valles Caldera that it was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1975.\nThe land, given in 1860 to the Cabeza de Vaca family to settle a land claim dispute with the federal government, lies in the Jemez (pronounced HAY-mez) Mountains to the west of Santa Fe. It changed hands several times since then, ending up in the holdings of the Dunigan family of Abilene, Tex., who ran it as a ranch.\nAccording to a Forest Service study conducted by the Santa Fe National Forest in the early 1990's, the National Park Service has been interested in the area since the 1930's and had from time to time explored buying it. For one reason or another, though, these efforts came to nothing until last July, when the government bought it from the family; the price was $101 million for about 90,000 acres.\nThe Dunigan family had sharply limited public access to the property. According to the Forest Service, only about 200 people a year visited the ranch, including its employees and clients who paid to hunt elk there.\nNow that the government owns the place, though, pressure from those who want to use it is likely to be intense. The population in nearby cities and towns in New Mexico has increased rapidly in recent years, and tourism in the area is also expanding. In theory, the property could attract thousands of people for hiking, camping, fishing, skiing, snowmobiling and so on. Some in the Forest Service worry that this kind of heavy use could substantially degrade the preserve.\nReconciling the demands for the property will be the job of a nine-member board, to include experts on livestock, forestry and local history, which will govern the trust. Once President Clinton appoints the board, which he is expected to do soon, it will begin drawing up plans for managing the property and allowing public access to it. Until then, the preserve will be administered by the Forest Service and public access will be limited."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Q.: Watching ants traveling in a line, I noticed they meet head-on for a moment, then continue on their way. Is this some type of communication?\nA.: If there was any foreleg contact or waving about of antennas by the ants, some communication may have been involved. But the wide range of communication methods among ants is weighted heavily toward chemical signals, and visual signals have not been solidly documented, according to ''The Ants,'' the classic study by Bert Holldobler and Dr. Edward O. Wilson (Harvard, 1990).\nAnt communication, which has been extensively but not exhaustively studied, includes tappings, chirplike grating noises, ''strokings, graspings, nudgings, antennations, tastings, and puffings and streakings of chemicals,'' the book says, as well as bizarre activities like the exchange of special eggs and anal secretions.\nIn a typical worker ant, more than 10 organs have been implicated in producing just one class of chemical signal. However, a typical ant colony operates with only about 10 to 20 signals, most of them chemical.\nIf a fire ant is laying a food trail using such signals and meets another worker, the homeward-bound worker may turn to face her, rushing into her before continuing on, or even pausing briefly to shake her, but researchers think this behavior may only serve to enhance the effects of the chemical being used.

{"headline": null, "content": "HERE we are again in the writers' room -- well, actually, in the closet, a few paces down the corridor from the spot where the likes of Neil Simon and Mel Brooks once polished jokes for Sid Caesar -- with Judith E. Daykin, current landlady of the writers' room. How many landlords would have a eureka moment when they saw the words ''Your Show of Shows'' on scripts that had been left undisturbed in the closet for decades?\n''I knew,'' says Ms. Daykin, the president of City Center, the domed complex of theaters, rehearsal rooms and offices that was home to ''Your Show of Shows'' in the 1950's. Ms. Daykin had studied that era extensively in preparing ''Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert,'' the critically acclaimed revivals she has produced at City Center since 1994. And, at 59, she is old enough to remember when Sid Caesar was Mr. Saturday Night, live, on a newfangled invention known as television.\nSome landlords might have said, ''Throw that junk away.'' But Ms. Daykin's instant decision to save it all has drawn praise from the likes of Patrick Loughney, head of the moving-image section of the Library of Congress, which will make the papers part of its collection. And, after The New York Times reported the discovery last week, television news crews swarmed through City Center, sending images of the closet to the world.\nMs. Daykin could not be happier, though this is hardly how she expected to while away her 15 minutes of fame. ''We're always eclipsed by Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, so it's a positive benefit for City Center to be so visible,'' she said.\nIt has been a tricky climb from obscurity. In 1992, when Ms. Daykin took over as head of the landmarked neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street, it had long been in decline and its 2,300-seat theater was lighted only 17 weeks a year -- in comparison with 40 weeks this year.\nIn her first year, Ms. Daykin retired the center's accumulated debt of $750,000 and shored up marketing and fund-raising. The next year, in what was to be the turning point of her reign, she introduced ''Encores!,'' the star-studded revival series that returned the center to New York's theatrical Rolodex. Now Ms. Daykin is shooting for 45 weeks' occupancy in the structure, which was built for Shriners in 1923 and acquired by the city in 1943.\n''We share our costs with other tenants there,'' said Barry Grove, executive producer of the Manhattan Theater Club, which has rented two auditoriums in the center since 1984, ''so it is important to us that Judith has brought in other tenants for us to share costs with. She's brought the center back.''\nBut Ms. Daykin has faced a variety of challenges, many involving what she called ''this beautiful old building that requires constant attention.'' She is about to embark on an essential $3.5 million city-financed renovation of the leaking tile dome.\nALSO daunting is maintaining the center's artistic relevance, and not all of Ms. Daykin's initiatives have been home runs. She now refers to the center's 1998 offering of the Stratford Festival of Canada as ''a miserable defeat'' after it drew tepid reviews and lost $400,000.\nThese days, Ms. Daykin walks a nonprofit tightrope, trying to foster City Center's financial and creative success as it houses longtime tenants. Increasingly they have to share the prodigious costs of production in the unionized house, with its $10 million budget, 38 full-time employees and several hundred part-timers.\nAs a result, Ms. Daykin has critics in the dance world, though none would speak for attribution. A consortium of dance companies actually banded together to run the languishing center in 1975 to prevent it from closing its doors. But these days the center charges dance groups enough so that a City Center run can be unprofitable for some companies; others complain that her staff members can be unsympathetic.\nMs. Daykin countered that her staff ''does everything it can to provide help and counsel and support,'' adding, ''We do not gouge, but we can't give them the theater for nothing.'' While City Center's costs are $65,000 a week, she said, she charges dance companies $35,000 a week. As for her own administrative style, she acknowledged, ''I can be brusque.''\nSome on the other side of the bargaining table see Ms. Daykin as tough but fair. ''She is a good businesswoman,'' said Mr. Grove of the Manhattan Theater Club, which negotiated a new 15-year lease last year. During the deal-making dance, ''she was absolutely focused on what was right and fair,'' he said, adding, ''The lease respected us while respecting her own interest as well.''\nMs. Daykin grew up in Princeton, Ill., trained as an actress at the University of Iowa and performed in shows across the country. For eight years until 1974, she was a manager at the Paul Taylor Dance Company. During her subsequent 15-year tenure as second in command at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, she helped begin and build the influential Next Wave Festival.\nMs. Daykin still lives in Brooklyn and has a long-term relationship with John Price, a retired theater producer with whom she shares a house in Key West, Fla.\nNow she has started ''Voices!,'' a play-revival counterpart to ''Encores!,'' and she is looking for more corporate heavy hitters on her 21-member board. ''I'm not finished,'' Ms. Daykin said of the center, ''and it hasn't finished me.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "A man lingered yesterday morning in two stairwells at a Queens elementary school, where he sexually assaulted a child who was running an errand for her teacher and groped three other pupils before getting away, the police said.\nInvestigators said the children, who are 6, 7 and 8 years old, were molested in three separate incidents from 8:30 to 8:50 a.m. between floors at Public School 89 in the Elmhurst section of Queens.\nSchool officials speculated that the man was an intruder who had slipped in a side door that had been left unlocked, but the police did not rule out the possibility that he was a school employee. Board of Education officials were also investigating why officials at the school did not notify the police last week after a student reported encountering a strange man in a stairwell, a board spokeswoman said.\nParents who gathered outside the school to pick up their children in the afternoon said they were angry that such a thing could happen in a city school, especially to children so young. ''My boy is afraid,'' said Sara Abecillas, whose son is a third grader. She said she was concerned that the school lacked adequate security. Under the usual procedures, parents said, visitors are required to sign in and to enter either the main door, which is guarded by the school's one security officer, or one of two other doors, which are locked or guarded by a school employee.\nThe police said the man approached three pairs of students over about 20 minutes. Their teachers had asked them to deliver attendance records to the main office, the police said. At 8:30 a.m., two 7-year-olds, a boy and a girl, were going down a stairwell when the man approached them and groped the girl, the police said.\nAbout 10 minutes later, the man groped two 8-year-olds, a boy and a girl, in the same stairwell, the police said. He then moved to another stairwell, they said, where he accosted two 6-year-old girls, one of whom he sexually assaulted.\nSeven students at the school, six girls and one boy, were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center yesterday, said Dario L. Centorcelli, a hospital spokesman. Most were treated only for emotional trauma and were expected to be released by this morning, officials said.\nWhile the police said the students immediately reported the incidents to their teachers, it is not clear why the man was not caught.\nSchool officials said they believed that the man had entered through a side door that had apparently been left unlocked after an early delivery of candy for a school fund-raiser. But the police had not ruled out other explanations. ''We're still talking to people,'' said Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman. ''We're still investigating who the suspect is.''\nThe Board of Education, meanwhile, was looking into the incident last week that was not reported to the police. Pam McDonnell, a board spokeswoman, said a third grader told her mother last week that a strange man had approached her in a stairwell. The children who were approached yesterday said that man had told them to close their eyes, one official said, and the man made a similar remark to the girl last week.\nThe girl's mother went to the school the following day, Ms. McDonnell said, and reported the encounter to the principal and a guidance counselor. But the police were not contacted until yesterday, she said.\nThat incident ''clearly was of concern enough to the parent to come to the school on Friday and report it,'' Ms. McDonnell said. However, she said: ''The school did not see it at that point as a reportable incident because it was open school week. There were a lot of comings and goings.''\nThe school superintendent is investigating ''why communication broke down at this point,'' Ms. McDonnell said, and is considering taking disciplinary action against officials at the elementary school.\nMs. McDonnell said yesterday that she did not know whether the school had a buddy system requiring that students travel in pairs. ''I don't know whether it's required or suggested,'' she said.\nSome parents said the school's principal sent home a letter yesterday emphasizing that students would be instructed to report intruders immediately. Angela Garcia, who has a son in the first grade at P.S. 89, said she did not receive the letter. Her son told her he was instructed not to speak with strangers but was not told why, she said. ''I'm terrified,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''I don't want to send him to school this week.''\nThough crime in schools was down last year over all, sexual offenses more than doubled during the most recent period for which statistics were readily available. Police officials have said, however, that the increase may be a result of reporting procedures adopted in 1998, when the Police Department began training school safety officers in new standards to detect sexual abuse."},

No matter what other burdens afflict us, at least we are not counting votes in Broward County.\nThose of us who live in New York are planning to give thanks that we reside in a chad-free zone. After decades of complaining about the ancient voting machines, we suddenly appreciate our good fortune. Sure, they break down a lot, but they're really excellent when it comes to limiting the voters to one candidate per race. Legend has it that New York produces more election law litigation every year than the rest of the nation combined, but this month somebody else has finally taken away the title. Just the other day Broadway Democrats, a political club in Manhattan, was forced to send out fliers for its post-election symposium with the name of the speaker left blank. ''We couldn't find an election lawyer -- they're all in Florida,'' explained one of the organizers.\nMemo to Thanksgiving diners: give thanks that the election lawyers have all gone south.\nWe are also grateful this week for the Electoral College. Sure, it's gotten some bad press over the last couple of weeks, but the Electoral College is an important bulwark against regional candidates who could win the popular vote by rolling up huge, huge majorities in just one part of the country. I learned all about this from the Gore campaign, which was extremely enthusiastic about the Electoral College until two weeks ago.\nBut think about it, people. Right now Al Gore is leading George W. Bush by about 200,000 votes out of 100 million. If the popular vote picked the president, the Bush camp would be demanding recounts everywhere. Everybody's idiot state legislators would have to explain why they didn't write the election laws so they made sense. (The Republican attorneys have been attempting to compare the Florida lawmakers to the Founding Fathers, an analogy that only works if you presume the Founding Fathers saved up all their work until the last day of the session and then passed the Constitution as part of a huge basket of legislation that included several bond issues and Thomas Jefferson's expense account.)\nIf we had no Electoral College, by the time the recounters got to New York -- which has still not managed to declare a winner in a State Senate race -- we would have to simply throw in the towel and agree to let Dennis Hastert run the country. And let's be grateful there's no presidential recount in the State of Washington, which appears to bring the ballots in by pony express and then let them age in oak casks for a month or two before they're ready to be sampled.\nOn Thursday, we will also give thanks that we do not have to do spin for either of the embattled presidential candidates. We are particularly appreciative that we did not have to denounce the 39 voting Florida felons on behalf of Mr. Bush, a chore that required working up a rage over the fact that a convicted drunken driver was allowed to go to the polls.\nAnd we are grateful that we are not involved in any of the other seemingly endless series of contests that are going to wind up being decided by one slightly dusty absentee ballot that was filled in with crayon. We are thinking particularly of the House race in New Jersey where the losing Republican keeps demanding a recount (''I owe it to the people who voted for me'') while the winning Democrat keeps shaking his head and muttering something about the infallibility of the machines.\nWe acknowledge the blessing of not being responsible for those transition-team photographs Mr. Bush posed for early on, in which he attempted to look presidential but only managed to look like a turtle with a skin problem. ''It was like Dukakis and the tank,'' chortled one former White House official.\nPerhaps we should mention, once again, that we are especially glad not to be playing the part of Jeb Bush at the family feast. And when we are offered another slice of turkey, we will give extra thanks that we are not the guy in Florida who's been charged with eating a chad.\nOh yes, and thank you in advance for a mandate-free presidency."},

''We are committed to building this team the right way, and to have Smith select Detroit as his home is an endorsement of that.''\nSigning Smith, who has averaged a career 14.5 points a game, is a step toward rebuilding the team after Hill's departure to the Orlando Magic as a free agent.

But point guard Stephon Marbury, as usual, was calm, wearing his headphones to tune out the ordeal.\nIn a ragged display of basketball, Marbury and the Nets eventually overcame poor shooting and a scrappy young Clippers team, seizing an 86-85 victory to start the four-game road swing.\nDespite slightly twisting his ankle at the beginning of the second quarter, Marbury scored 28 points and the rookie Kenyon Martin had his second straight double-double with 19 points and a career-high 15 rebounds as the Nets won their third straight close game down the stretch.\nLamar Odom's 3-pointer brought the Clippers within 1 point with 2.1 seconds left. Los Angeles fouled the veteran Johnny Newman, who missed both of his free throws, but the Nets survived, not minding the distractions.\nThe Clippers came within 1 point with 3 minutes 6 seconds left to play, but Marbury answered with a 3-pointer and Martin came down with a huge rebound on the next possession, preserving a 79-75 lead. Although Marbury missed two free throws on his next trip, Newman, who hit the shot that ensured the victory Saturday, got the rebound and the follow-up basket.\nThe Clippers' Sean Rooks scored to bring his team with 3 again, but Newman's 3-pointer with 48.7 seconds to play gave the Nets an 84-78 lead, just enough of a cushion.\nThis road trip had an odd beginning and the Nets struggled throughout the game to dominate. But they took advantage of the Clippers' youth, forcing 21 turnovers and scoring 23 points off them.\nThe Nets took a 64-56 lead into the fourth quarter, after Kendall Gill and Stephen Jackson hit two huge 3-pointers and Marbury paced the Nets again with 8 key points in the third quarter. The Nets were starting to throw off their early malaise.\nThe Nets had one personnel problem. Center Evan Eschmeyer came down with the flu less than 48 hours after he received a flu shot. And in the beginning of this game, the Nets appeared to be without focus and out of sync.\nOdom, the Clippers' young star, had seven rebounds in the first quarter alone to pace his team, while 7-foot Michael Olowokandi overwhelmed Eschmeyer's backup, Jim McIlvaine. Los Angeles raced to a 10-point lead in the first quarter, but the Nets cut the deficit to 2 by scoring 7 straight points to end the first quarter.\nAlthough the Nets forced the Clippers into 31.8 percent shooting, Los Angeles got to the foul line 14 times in the first quarter. The Nets did not shoot a free throw until just 2:01 was left in the second quarter.\nThe second quarter began inauspiciously when Marbury, the Nets' precious 23-year-old superstar, who has seemed invincible this season, landed awkwardly on his right ankle off a jump shot. With Marbury on the bench, the Nets were unable to score. But the Clippers contributed to the drought.\nFinally, Newman, the Nets' old reliable, broke the standoff, hitting a jump shot 3:14 into the second quarter to tie the score at 24-24.\nAfter Marbury came back with his ankle taped with 4:25 left in the half, he sparked the Nets to a comeback. Even mildly injured, he scored 13 points in the first half, while Newman added 8 points.\nThe Clippers are a young team featuring four draft picks, but none seemed ready to emerge tonight. Darius Miles, the No. 3 pick over all and the high school superstar who reneged on his commitment to St. John's for the draft, missed both of his shots and had four turnovers in eight minutes of the first half, a symbol for a group that is a work in progress.\nThe Nets, on the other hand, have shown progress by surging over .500 for the first time in three seasons.\nREBOUNDS\nKERRY KITTLES, rehabilitating from knee surgery in Los Angeles, sat behind the Nets bench during the game. . . .

{"headline": null, "content": "Giants wide receiver Ike Hilliard will not play in Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals, and could be sidelined indefinitely, because of a bruise to his lungs and sternum, which he sustained in the Giants' loss to Detroit Sunday. Hilliard was hurt when he collided with Detroit safety Kurt Schulz while trying to catch a pass over the middle. Schulz, who hit Hilliard in the chest and head with his shoulders and helmet, was penalized for unnecessary roughness.\nHilliard, who required neck fusion surgery after a similar collision three seasons ago, has been hospitalized in Manhattan since Sunday night and will remain under observation for two more days. The Giants said Hilliard's neck was not injured and that X-rays showed no fractures.\n''It's mainly to the lungs,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ''He has had a cardiovascular guy look at him, and after about 48 hours, we'll see what they think and how he has responded. We haven't gotten that report yet. What does it mean after this week? I don't know that right now.''\nFassel would not call Schulz's hit illegal, but added: ''The guy came in high. It was a pretty good hit, and Ike was going pretty hard, too. I'll leave that to the league. They can take whatever action they want.''\nHilliard's loss will have the Giants' receivers scrambling. Amani Toomer and Joe Jurevicius had concussions two weeks ago, but each played Sunday. Still, Toomer and Jurevicius normally play the same position. Jurevicius will likely be switched to Hilliard's side, but the Giants will also need the rookie Ron Dixon back in the lineup. Dixon hasn't played in three weeks because of a foot sprain.\nFassel said he expected Dixon to play against Arizona. If Hilliard is out any length of time, Dixon's durability will become an important factor. The Giants' third-round draft pick this year, Dixon has had nagging injuries and has caught just four passes. The Giants fourth receiver is Thabiti Davis, who has two receptions.\nHilliard has 45 receptions this season for 639 yards and a team-leading 6 touchdowns. Toomer leads the team in catches with 51 and running back Tiki Barber is second with 48 receptions."},

{"headline": null, "content": "With five games to go in the regular season, a playoff berth far from assured and his team on a two-game losing streak, Giants Coach Jim Fassel returned to a vexing problem of preseason basics. Since training camp, Fassel has dedicated extra attention to the improvement of his special teams.\nToday became yet another day in that struggle because time is running out.\nDisgusted by the Giants' special-teams play in Sunday's 31-21 loss to Detroit, Fassel cut Bashir Levingston, a cornerback and kick returner, who made three pivotal special-teams mistakes in the game. Fassel also said he would begin using starting players on the coverage units.\nGiants fans should not, however, have visions of Michael Strahan or Kerry Collins running down under punts -- or worse, a resurrection of the one-play experiment of Jason Sehorn returning kickoffs in 1998 that proved disastrous. The changes will be far less dramatic, expanding the roles of someone like safety Shaun Williams, or his fellow safety Sam Garnes.\nWide receiver Ron Dixon, who had been replaced by Levingston because of a foot injury, is expected to return.\nAnd while the focus of much criticism has been on the special-teams coach, Larry Mac Duff, Fassel once again deflected the blame from his assistant. Mac Duff also denied that he had lost a handle on the job.\nAll in all, even on a day when they received so much attention, the Giants' special teams were not feeling special at all.\n''We cannot perform on special teams like that again and expect to win again, and it's that simple,'' said Fassel, whose Giants had a punt blocked, two punts returned deep into their territory and a 67-yard punt return of their own nullified by a holding penalty.\nSo Fassel will turn to his best players for help.\n''I'm not going to be stupid about it,'' he said when asked if his star players might play on special teams. ''But there isn't anybody that will be excused if they can help us.''\nQuestioned about Mac Duff, Fassel said the special-teams players were prepared and well coached but do not follow their directives. Fassel also denied that he has defended Mac Duff because the two were teammates at Fullerton College in 1967 and assistant coaches together at Stanford from 1980 to 1983.\n''I don't hire buddies,'' Fassel said. ''I hire good, thorough coaches. I evaluate coaches.''\nAs for punter Brad Maynard's assertion after Sunday's game that other players have been inattentive and have clowned around in special-teams meetings, Fassel said: ''I don't believe that. I totally disagree with that 100 percent.''\nMaynard did not retract his comments today, though he was reluctant to expound on them.\n''Maybe it's something that didn't need to be said,'' Maynard said. ''But then again, maybe it was needed. It doesn't matter. I was frustrated and I said what I said.''\nMaynard, in his fourth year with the Giants, questioned the effort of some players on the punt coverage team after Sunday's game. While Fassel said he did not agree with Maynard's remarks, he conceded that players on the punt team were not doing their jobs.\n''Any time the team that you are playing starts five drives inside your 40-yard line, something is wrong,'' Fassel said.\nFassel gave Mac Duff his first National Football League job in 1997, after Mac Duff had worked as a college coach. He spent 10 years as the defensive coordinator at Arizona and had several other jobs as a defensive assistant coach. In the early 1980's, at Hawaii, MacDuff was the defensive line coach and special-teams coordinator.\nToday, Mac Duff did not chafe at the suggestion that his meetings were disorderly, but said: ''I've been in coaching 30 years. I know how to run a meeting. At times, maybe there's some laughter or things like that. I can't let things be too serious all the time. But the guys are paying attention.''\n''I don't worry about my job,'' he added. ''I have to do a complete evaluation of how we're going to get better. The bottom line is performance, and obviously there are some things I haven't gotten across.''\nThe last two games, in particular, exposed the Giants' punt coverage deficiencies. Desmond Howard set up one Detroit touchdown with a 50-yard punt return and had a 30-yard punt return. Maynard's blocked punt also set up a Lions touchdown.\nIn the game against St. Louis on Nov. 12, the Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim ran back 3 punts for 92 yards, one that set up a touchdown.\nFor the season, Giants opponents have averaged 13.5 yards a punt return and 23.9 yards a kickoff return. The Giants' average punt return is 8.2 yards and their average kickoff return is 19.9 yards.\nLast season, Levingston averaged 24.2 yards a kickoff return for the Giants. But an ankle injury kept him out of their first eight games this year, and when he returned, Giants coaches complained about his work habits. In the second quarter Sunday, Levingston fumbled a kickoff that was recovered by the Lions, and he was also called for holding on Tiki Barber's 67-yard punt return.\nAs the right outside contain man on the punt coverage, Levingston was also held responsible by Giants coaches for Howard's 30-yard return because he ran to the middle of the field rather than guard the edge of the field as assigned."},
{"headline": null, "content": "A magnetic resonance imaging exam confirmed yesterday that Marcus Camby had incurred only a sprain of his left ankle. He traveled with the Knicks when they flew to Orlando, Fla., for tonight's game with the Magic.\nThe news on Camby came after the undersized Knicks showed they could survive without their leading rebounder -- at least for a game -- when they beat the Golden State Warriors, 88-71, Sunday night.\nBut while the Knicks were tentatively able to answer questions about their makeup without Camby, the 7-foot player still has to answer questions about himself.\nCamby was listed as day to day after the M.R.I. revealed no additional damage. But the fragile Camby has been day to day throughout his career. He has never played more than 63 games during the first four seasons of his career.\nCamby has sat out with a variety of injuries, from a lower-back strain that sidelined him for 14 consecutive games in his rookie year to a strained anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee last year that kept him out of 17 consecutive games.\nHis latest injury came in the fourth quarter of the Knicks' 90-85 victory against the Suns at Phoenix on Friday night. The setback spoiled a season start in which Camby had exerted himself not only as the starting center in the spot vacated by Patrick Ewing, but also as the team's most reliable player.\nIn the first 10 games, Camby averaged 12.0 points and 12.2 rebounds a game. The rebounding total ranks him third in the National Basketball Association, and his 2.7 blocks a game rank seventh.\n''He's been playing great,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said before Sunday's victory. ''He's been, by far, our best player so far, our most consistent player. It's not even close.\n''The only thing that can stop him from having a great year is injuries. I think the only thing he has to concern himself with right now is doing everything he can to get back, as I know he will. He's always been very, very good at rehabilitation. I think he's got to come back playing well. You can't be hesitant. You can't be tentative. You've got to come out and play, and I think he'll do that.''\nThere has never been a question of Camby's talent or potential since he arrived in the N.B.A. with the Toronto Raptors as the No. 2 pick over all in the 1996 draft. The questions have centered on his work ethic and his ability to stay healthy, questions Camby wishes would have subsided by now.\n''I'm not really disappointed,'' Camby said of his latest setback before undergoing the M.R.I. on Sunday. ''I just go out there and try to play, and my health is the most important thing right now. I wanted to play, but the doctors said, 'Go get the M.R.I.' If things go right, I'll be out there as soon as possible.''\nCamby tried to coax Van Gundy into sending him back into the game in Phoenix after undergoing X-rays at the arena. Tonight, he will no doubt try to talk his way into the lineup. But if the Knicks choose to rest Camby, Sunday's performance eased some of the concern about how the Knicks will survive without him.\nLarry Johnson grabbed 16 rebounds as the Knicks outrebounded the Warriors, 42-41. Kurt Thomas stepped into Camby's starting role and scored 17 points in 32 minutes. And Felton Spencer, an 11th-year veteran who had played only 13 minutes this season, responded with 22 solid minutes in which he scored 7 points and pulled down 7 rebounds.\nAfter Sunday's game, Johnson said: ''We've got to do what we did tonight: go out there and play. I think guys like Kurt are going to welcome that opportunity. That's the way this league is. Injuries are not something you can predict. So once it happens, definitely to a marquee player like we had, that's what practice is for. Felton takes reps in practice. Kurt takes reps in practice. Now it's time for those reps to become real.''\nSpencer said of his role: ''It's tough because it's unexpected. You never know when your opportunity is going to come. I just try to keep myself ready, do extra conditioning and stay in shape, so when I do get the opportunity I can take advantage of it and maybe earn some more time, keep myself in the back of Jeff's head, so to speak. Maybe he'll think of me a little more often. We're all trying to make sure we can pick up the slack for Marcus being out.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "If the Jets' defense was the cornerstone of their 20-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, then their medical team may be the critical unit for the Jets this week.\nCoach Al Groh said running back Curtis Martin was scheduled to be examined by team doctors and undergo tests today for a murky injury that Groh, always very evasive about injuries, did nothing to clarify.\nNo test results were made available.\nWhen Martin was removed from Sunday's game early in the third quarter, it was announced that he had a strained back.\nBut today, Groh said Martin would have an X-ray of his hip and that the injury was in the ''general pelvic region.'' Groh insisted that he had not been given much specific information about Martin's injury and that he had not inquired beyond asking the player a few times in the locker room and on the flight home how he was doing.\nMartin, who did not seem to be in pain in the locker room after the game, told Groh he was doing fine.\nGroh gave the players the day off, so Martin was not available for comment today.\nBut after the game Sunday, Martin did not appear to be uncomfortable. He did say that ''something isn't right.'' His agent, Eugene Parker, did not return a call to his Indiana-based office.\nGroh was remarkably flippant about the status of Martin, the Jets' most important player.\n''If he plays, he plays,'' Groh said. ''If he doesn't, he doesn't. That's about the extent of where we'll go with that. We'll put him on the injury report on Wednesday and get on with the club we have, whether it's Curtis or anybody else.''\nGroh also announced that receiver Laveranues Coles would miss Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears with a sprained left knee, which he sustained while returning the opening kickoff of the second half.\nGroh compared Coles's injury with those sustained earlier in the season by Martin and tight end Anthony Becht, but said it was too early to know how long Coles would be out. Martin missed no games with his knee injury, but Becht was inactive for two games.\nGroh said either Aaron Glenn or Tony Scott would replace Coles on kickoff returns. The rookie receiver Windrell Hayes played in place of Coles as a receiver Sunday.\nMartin is an extremely durable player and has not missed a game since 1998, when he had a thigh injury that kept him out of a midseason game against the St. Louis Rams. If he misses time now, with the Jets fighting for a playoff spot, it would be an enormous blow to the team's fragile offense.\nWith quarterback Vinny Testaverde still unable to shed the interceptions that have plagued him all season -- he has 17 after throwing two against the Dolphins -- Martin is the Jets' most dependable and productive offensive weapon.\nMartin has 862 yards on 218 carries for a 4-yard average. He also has seven touchdowns. In an offense that is still trying to fill the gap in receptions left by the departure of Keyshawn Johnson, Martin is also vital to the passing game. He is the team's third leading receiver with 47 receptions -- only one behind Wayne Chrebet -- for 338 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nIf Martin is unavailable, the Jets would primarily use Bernie Parmalee, who performed superbly in relief of Martin on Sunday. Groh said Parmalee, who was plagued by his own foot and hamstring injuries earlier this season, looked the quickest he has all year.\nBut Groh did not rule out using Richie Anderson and Jerald Sowell in the spot, too. But the coach became irritated when asked if the Jets would consider signing another running back if Martin's injury proved to be lingering.\n''The fourth running back is not going to replace Curtis Martin,'' Groh said. ''We have the team that we have, and that's the team we're going to play with.\n''He's one of our better players, one of the better players in the league. By the same token, we thrived with Bernie in there. By the same token, Denver thrived with Mike Anderson in there, who was their third choice. If you want to put together a good season in this league, everybody confronts these issues.''\nEXTRA POINTS\nCoach AL GROH said he is as happy with the free safety position, now occupied by CHRIS HAYES, as he has been all season. Groh praised Hayes, who is the third person to start at free safety this season. Hayes had three tackles and the first interception of his career against the Dolphins. ''He's done a nice job,'' Groh said. ''The job description is to defend the deep ball and tackle. He made a number of good tackles and he had one opportunity on a deep ball and he intercepted it. In terms of meeting the primary criteria, he did a good job. Chris puts a high level of passion into what he does. We've seen that with special teams. We can see it in the way he's playing defense. He's being rewarded for it by the performance he's getting.'' . . . Groh did not criticize DEDRIC WARD's decisions to call for four fair catches on the Dolphins' six punts. ''That's part of the team profile,'' Groh said. ''We're not a dynamic punt-return team.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "Any concert dedicated to showcasing little-known work by younger theater composers deserves points simply for challenging an audience with the unfamiliar. And on Friday evening, the Carnegie Hall program ''New Faces on Broadway'' by the New York Pops offered songs by Michael John LaChiusa, Ricky Ian Gordon, Adam Guettel and Jason Robert Brown, four heralded Young Turks of American musical theater.\nTheir songs, decked out in spiffy (uncredited) orchestrations, were performed by four big-voiced singers: Jason Danieley, Marin Mazzie, Billy Porter and Emily Skinner. The event was the brainchild of the orchestra's associate conductor, Charles Prince, who alternated at the podium with its founder, Skitch Henderson.\nBut from the show's title, a misnomer (only two of the four, Mr. LaChiusa and Mr. Brown, have had shows on Broadway), to its crude shoehorning of warhorses like ''Maria'' and ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue'' into the program, the concert was largely a catalog of missed opportunities that left the audience unimpressed. Most of the new material was minimally rehearsed, and an undercurrent of generational tension between Mr. Prince (who conducted the newer songs) and Mr. Henderson (the old) weighed heavily.\nThe evening opened with three selections by Mr. LaChiusa, including two from the ill-fated Public Theater production of ''The Wild Party.'' Taken out of context and orchestrally pumped up, ''The Wild Party'' songs held their own as tuneful 1920's pastiches texturally roughened to evoke the underside of Jazz Age hedonism. If neither loomed as a standard, heard out of context they demonstrated Mr. LaChiusa's under-appreciated talent for making music that serves the drama, instead of the reverse.\nMr. Gordon, the least Broadway-oriented of the four, received the best orchestral treatment in billowing, impressionistic arrangements that underscored his gift for buoyant romantic melodies whose unpredictable paths (especially in his settings of Langston Hughes and James Agee) recall the urbane Americana of Samuel Barber's ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915.''\nIn the evening's most fully realized performance, Ms. Mazzie and Ms. Skinner joined voices for a thrilling rendition of ''Summer,'' a glorious sunburst of vocal fanfares.\nMr. Guettel's ''Light in the Piazza Suite,'' an orchestral digest of melodies from a musical work in progress, suggested a pastoral tone poem by Delius, but the diffuse meandering arrangement failed to bring the melodies to the surface. Mr. Danieley's performance of Mr. Guettel's masterpiece, ''How Glory Goes,'' from the Off Broadway musical ''Floyd Collins,'' was too stiff to fly.\nUnlike the other younger composers, Mr. Brown is an unabashed cornball in the stentorian 1980's Broadway mode of ''Les Miserables.'' At his worst, in the bombastic ''Christopher Columbus'' and the mawkish ''Music of Heaven'' (which the composer performed in a sobbing baritone), Mr. Brown shamelessly recycled inspirational cliches.\nBut Ms. Skinner's performance of ''Stars and the Moon'' (already a cabaret standard) and ''All the Wasted Time,'' the climactic stirring duet (sung by Mr. Danieley and Ms. Mazzie) from ''Parade,'' demonstrated his skill at writing two-fisted dramatic ballads that hit home."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Many people are all too familiar with this condition: It starts with a cold that lingers well beyond the 7 to 10 days colds usually last, leaving a person feeling stuffed up, dragged out, headachy and irritable. Or perhaps it begins with a spring or fall allergy, but long after the person is no longer exposed to pollen or mold spores, discomforting respiratory symptoms persist.\nIt is in all likelihood a sinus infection -- sinusitis in medical parlance, an ailment that afflicts an about 37 million Americans each year, that is now soaring in prevalence and that is the fifth most common reason for which antibiotics are prescribed. But, experts say, in many cases that prescription is inappropriate and ill-advised, and this misuse of antibiotics is contributing to a growing medical crisis: antibiotic resistance among common bacterial causes of respiratory infections.\nSinus infections actually know no seasons, but as the weather cools and upper respiratory infections race through families, friends and work sites, the chance that one or more people will wind up with sinusitis sharply increases. Thus, it is important for everyone to know when to suspect sinusitis, when and how to self-treat and when a doctor's visit and antibiotics are warranted.\nCauses, Signs and Symptoms\nSinusitis is an infection in one or more of the sinus cavities, the air-filled spaces in the front of the skull that keep the head from being too heavy to hold up. There are four sets of sinus cavities located behind and around the nose and eyes. Three of those sets -- the maxillaries inside each cheekbone, the ethmoids between the eyes and the spenoids behind the nose -- are present at birth but do not develop fully until about the age of 20. The fourth set, the frontal sinuses above the eyes and nose and behind the forehead, does not begin to develop until about the age of 8.\nEach sinus cavity is connected to the nasal passages by a very thin tube that allows mucus to drain and air exchange to take place. An upper respiratory infection or nasal allergy can block drainage from a sinus cavity and permit a bacterial infection to take hold in the accumulating mucus.\nTypical symptoms of a bacterial sinus infection include nasal congestion, globs of thick yellow-green mucus, facial pain or pressure, sometimes pain in the upper teeth and a low-grade or a spiking fever. In distinguishing these symptoms from those of a common cold, duration and severity must be taken into account, according to Dr. Michael Benninger, an otolaryngologist in Detroit who took part in the recent development of treatment guidelines for sinusitis. When a cold gets worse after a week or persists for more than two weeks, chances are it has developed into a sinus infection.\nSeveral factors can increase chances that a sinus infection will develop on the heels of a cold or allergy, among them being overworked or overly stressed, not getting enough sleep, failing to exercise regularly (exercise increases infection-fighting white blood cells) and chronic exposure to environmental pollution.\nWhen people have a cold or suffer from a nasal allergy, there are a number of measures they can take to keep their sinuses clear and free of infection. Drink plenty of clear fluids to keep nasal discharge thin. Eat chicken soup; it has infection-fighting properties. Take an oral decongestant like pseudephedrine. Use a decongestant nasal spray for up to three days or use a saline nasal spray. When blowing the nose, block one nostril while blowing through the other. Avoid air travel, but if you must fly, take an oral decongestant beforehand and use a decongestant nasal spray two hours before landing.\nAvoid exposure to substances that can set off an allergy attack. If the person experiences an allergic reaction, he should use a prescription nasal spray or saline spray and one of the new nonsedating antihistamines (available only by prescription) to control symptoms. He should not smoke or go near anyone who does.\nTackling the Problem at Home\nIf a person suspects a bacterial sinus infection, unless symptoms are severe, it is reasonable to try to clear up the problem on one's own before consulting a doctor. Self-help measures include applying hot compresses, letting shower water as hot as is tolerable run over the face, using a steam vaporizer, using a saline nasal spray, taking a decongestant and an expectorant like guaifenesin (but not an over-the-counter antihistamine, which can thicken secretions), using a decongestant nasal spray (for three days only), taking an analgesic for pain and, if needed at night, a cough suppressant. Based on a review of 9,000 studies, Dr. Benninger said that in half or more cases, the body eventually fights off a bacterial sinus infection without an antibiotic. But he concedes that people do get better faster if they take an antibiotic.\nThere are two problems with antibiotics, however. Rarely does the doctor determine which bacterium is the culprit before choosing an antibiotic, and the growing incidence of antibiotic resistance may mean that the first drug chosen does not work and a second more potent antibiotic may have to be taken. If the patient consults an otolaryngologist, a procedure called nasal endoscopy using a local anesthetic might be done to examine the inside of the nose, to assess sinus drainage, to obtain a sample of infected mucus and to determine which drug can best combat the bacteria.\nIf an antibiotic is used, it is crucial to take the prescribed doses each day until the supply is finished. Do not stop the drug after a few days upon beginning to feel better; chances are there are still some tough bacteria present that could develop antibiotic resistance and result in a difficult-to-treat case of chronic sinusitis. Chronic infections persist for 12 or more weeks and are characterized by persistent facial pain or pressure, facial congestion, nasal obstruction, a thick discolored nasal discharge, pus in the nasal cavity and sometimes fever, headache, bad breath and fatigue.\nFor those plagued by chronic sinusitis or frequent sinus infections, a surgical procedure may be recommended to remove tissue that may be obstructing sinus drainage and to enlarge the natural opening to the sinuses. It can be done under local or general anesthesia. People can generally return to work within four days, but a full recovery usually takes about four weeks. A 28-day course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (or one chosen on the basis of mucus sampling) and treatment of any allergies is recommended before considering surgery.\nThe original problem can recur after surgery. If allergies are present, controlling or treating them remains essential to preventing a recurrence of chronic sinusitis. Among possible treatments are desensitization shots and the use of a steroid-based nasal spray, which can diminish the reactivity of the nasal passages to allergens.\nFor more information on integrating alternative remedies with traditional ones, consult ''Sinus Survival'' by Dr. Robert S. Ivker."},

{"headline": null, "content": "A year ago, Laurie Melzak-Klein, a 29-year-old social worker in Manalapan, N.J., was pregnant with her first child. She was carrying a boy, tests had shown, and he seemed perfectly healthy.\nBut at 20 weeks, her obstetrician told her and her husband, Bryan Klein, that their son could not survive. Ms. Melzak-Klein was bound to lose the pregnancy, he said, and should terminate it.\nAn ultrasound exam had shown that nearly all the amniotic fluid had leaked out of her womb. Without the fluid, the baby's lungs could not develop. Even if she did not end the pregnancy, he would die. Nothing could save him, the doctor insisted. And the longer she waited to terminate, the greater her own risk of developing an infection.\nThe loss of fluid was a rare complication from a medical procedure, amniocentesis, in which a needle is inserted through the woman's abdomen to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid for genetic tests. The needle punctures the uterus and the two membranes forming the sac that holds the fetus and the fluid.\nNormally, the punctures close quickly. But Ms. Melzak-Klein had had amniocentesis three weeks before, and the hole in the sac had failed to close, allowing fluid to escape. That complication is uncommon but serious, causing miscarriage in 1 in 400 to 1 in 200 women who have the procedure.\nTo a couple eagerly expecting their first baby, the outlook was devastating. Ms. Melzak-Klein said she felt guilt-ridden for having had the amniocentesis at all.\nIt is not normally recommended for women under 35, but her doctor had urged her to have it because a blood test called the ''triple screen'' had indicated that the fetus had a high risk of having Down syndrome. Ms. Melzak-Klein is diabetic, but did not find out until later that her diabetes could have affected the triple screen test.\nFriends urged her and her husband not to give up, but to consult specialists in high-risk pregnancy at New York University Medical Center. Two doctors there, Charles Lockwood and Bruce Young, saw Ms. Melzak-Klein the next morning, and offered a possible solution: an experimental operation in which Dr. Young would try to seal the ruptured membranes. If the repair worked, the sac would fill again, because at that stage of pregnancy, a large component of amniotic fluid is the fetus's urine.\n''We were willing to try anything,'' Ms. Melzak-Klein said.\nRuptured membranes, brought on in various ways, cause 30 percent to 40 percent of all premature births in the United States, or 133,000 to 178,000 cases a year.\nFetuses that are at least 28 weeks old have a good chance of doing well, Dr. Young said. But a quarter of the ruptures occur before the 26th week, when over half the fetuses die. Those that survive being born before 26 weeks have an increased risk of lung disease, blindness and cerebral palsy, and their health care costs just for neurological problems exceed $2 billion a year.\nWhile the rupture rate from amniocentesis is low, the procedure is so common that a significant number of miscarriages occur. Dr. Young estimates that several hundred a year occur in New York State alone.\nRuptures can also follow fetal surgery, which has become increasingly common to repair certain defects that would otherwise kill the fetus or cause severe disability. But the overwhelming majority of ruptures are spontaneous, occurring unexpectedly in women who have not had amniocentesis or other procedures. Some cases are due to infection, but often the cause is unknown.\nDr. Ruben Quintero, director of the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy at St. Joseph's Women's Hospital in Tampa, said, ''Amazingly, very few people have taken an interest in trying to repair the membranes.''\nDr. Quintero, one of the first doctors in this country to take on the problem, said he and his colleagues had developed a repair method, ''amniopatch,'' which they had used on about a dozen patients who had membrane ruptures after amniocentesis or other procedures. To seal the membranes, they use the woman's own blood platelets, the cell-like particles that help form clots, and a substance called cryoprecipitate, also made from her blood. The combination is injected into the sac, and when it comes into contact with the tear, seals it. Precisely how it works is not clear.\nOf seven patients described in a paper published last year in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dr. Quintero and his colleagues reported that the amniopatch had sealed the membranes in six. Three of the pregnancies had progressed well. Of the remaining four patients, one woman miscarried because of an abnormality not related to the procedure, and another terminated, also because of an abnormality. But two fetuses died in the womb unexpectedly.\nDr. Quintero said that another case, in which a fetus died during the procedure, made him and his colleagues realize that if they used too many platelets, the amniopatch itself could kill a fetus. ''Platelets have small packets of very potent substances,'' he said. The substances can cause lethal drops in the fetus's heart rate and blood pressure.\n''We did not know this,'' Dr. Quintero said. ''We did not know why some of our fetuses had died. We had no explanation for it until we could see it happening before our eyes in a patient. Since then, we have modified the protocol.'' Far fewer platelets are used than in the early cases, he said.\nSince the procedure was modified, he said, ''we've treated another four, and in all four cases, it has worked; the membranes seal, the patients go home and it's the end of the problem.'' He has told doctors at other hospitals how to do it, and some have used it, he said.\nBut Dr. Quintero emphasized that the amniopatch had not worked for women who had spontaneous ruptures of the membranes -- tears that were not related to amniocentesis or other procedures. He said he thought the technique failed because spontaneous tears tend to be larger than needle punctures and to occur immediately above the cervix, the outlet of the uterus.\nLikening the womb to a bathtub, he said: ''This is exactly smack over the drain. Adding something you want to stay, everything just goes down the drain.''\nIn one patient, instead of trying to use the amniopatch on a spontaneous rupture, he said, he tried an operation involving a tissue graft to seal the tear.\nDr. Young also uses platelets, but his technique is quite different from the amniopatch. Instead of using cryoprecipitate, he uses two other commercially prepared substances: collagen, a protein found in connective tissue, and fibrin, a blood protein that aids clotting.\nAnd because of the possible danger that platelets pose to the fetus, instead of injecting them into the sac, he puts them on the outer side of the sac, between the membrane and the uterine wall, close to the puncture. But he must first find the puncture in the membranes by scanning the inside of the uterus with a tiny video camera. The camera is within an endoscope, a hollow tube that also contains fiberoptics. The endoscope is contained in a needle that is inserted through the abdominal wall into the uterus, with the patient under general anesthesia.\n''When we locate the site, we're putting in platelets, which aggregate and form a latticework, and then fibrin, which forms a clot over the lattice, and then the collagen fibers, which form an actual plug,'' Dr. Young said, adding that he also uses the materials to close the openings made by his own instruments.\nHe and his colleagues explained to Ms. Melzak-Klein that the procedure was experimental. She and her husband discussed the idea. ''We thought we couldn't lose anything,'' she said. ''We could only gain.''\nOnce the instruments were inserted into the uterus, Dr. Young said, it took him about 30 minutes to find the tear in the membrane.\nInjected over the tear, the platelets and other materials set instantly, he said. The procedure took about an hour. Within a day, the sac had filled again. Ms. Melzak-Klein went home two days after the procedure. Two weeks later, she thought she noticed fluid again, and she spent the rest of her pregnancy, more than two months, in a hospital. But enough fluid remained to protect the fetus.\nAt 32 weeks of pregnancy, she developed a condition called pre eclampsia, in which her blood pressure shot up and could not be controlled. The baby, Elijah, weighing 2 pounds 12 ounces, was delivered by Caesarean section. His lungs were normal, and other than being very small, he was healthy.\n''We think the procedure has terrific potential,'' Dr. Young said. Like Dr. Quintero, he considers it especially promising for women with tears from amniocentesis or other procedures. He said he was teaching doctors in training how to do it.\nBut, he said: ''The likelihood of having people do it all over the country is small. I think it would be limited to a very few places around the country. You need skilled ultrasound and skilled individuals well trained in using endoscopes.'' And, he said, because the procedure will not always work and some babies will be very prematurely anyway, it should be done in a hospital with an intensive care unit for newborns.\nElijah is now 8 months old. ''He crawls and eats and babbles all day long,'' Mr. Melzak-Klein said. ''We feel lucky. It started as something very, very horrible, an unlucky situation that turned lucky.''\nShe hopes that other doctors and patients will hear about the procedure and that doctors ''will remember me the next time they're in a situation with a woman who is hysterical and who they're telling to terminate the pregnancy, and remember there are other options.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "Gerard Bachy, an engineer, stands 250 feet underground in an immense, bottle-shaped cavern that scientists around the world might regard as a kind of magic lantern. Thousands of those scientists hope, in effect, to rub this lantern and conjure a mysterious subatomic particle called the Higgs boson that their most trusted theories say is the source of all mass in the universe, the reason matter has weight.\nIf they are granted a few more wishes, those scientists may find strange things predicted by more speculative theories, like new dimensions, beyond the usual four, hidden in the fabric of space, and swarms of other unknown particles with odd properties -- discoveries that would remake humanity's view of the cosmos.\nMr. Bachy is the chief engineer for a colossal particle detector called Atlas that will be assembled, piece by piece, inside the cavern once it has been fully carved out of the gray rock. Science being what it is, researchers hope to create detectable bits of matter and explore reality not by actually putting their palms to a lamp but by smashing together other particles at a point about 30 feet below where Mr. Bachy is standing.\nA vertical tunnel for lowering detector parts from the surface tapers away over his head. Mr. Bachy, who is French, reaches for an analogy to describe the task of constructing the 7,000-ton detector, which will nearly fill the cavern when finished.\n''In matter of space, I would say it is like a submarine,'' he said. ''But in matter of technical complexity, it's close to the space program.''\nUnder construction here at CERN, the leading European particle physics laboratory, Atlas will be one of two giant detectors huddled around what will be the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Known as the Large Hadron Collider, the accelerator will occupy the same underground tunnel, a circle 17 miles in diameter, that now houses a less powerful machine that is marked for demolition. If all goes as planned, the $4 billion machine will begin collecting its first data in 2005.\nThe project's organization might be called massively international. Atlas alone will involve 1,800 scientists in 34 countries, including more than 30 institutions in the United States, which will contribute a total of about $500 million to the overall L.H.C. project.\nThe new accelerator will not be alone in its quest. At the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Chicago, an accelerator called the Tevatron is being upgraded and will begin collecting data in March. Although it will be less powerful than the L.H.C., the Tevatron has a chance of snatching away a discovery of the Higgs and other particles because it will start operating earlier.\nWhoever gets there first, scientists all over the world are bracing for a flood of discoveries that could help them sort out nature's order at its deepest levels -- or leave them horribly confused.\n''We have big expectations of what may appear at the new colliders,'' said Dr. Marcela Carena, a theorist at Fermilab. ''At the moment, we have a very good understanding of our world, but we know that this understanding is not final. We really want to get deep into the essence of particle physics and deep into the essence of understanding how nature works.''\nDr. James Siegrist, a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley and board chairman of the American institutions collaborating on Atlas, said that even if the Tevatron wins the Higgs race, there should be plenty of other discoveries to go around.\n''We would be astounded if we turned on and the Higgs was the only thing that was there,'' he said.\nParticle Politics\nBeyond the scientific intrigue, the push to dig deeper into the structure of matter and space comes with a heavy dose of politics as well.\nSince July, the accelerator -- called LEP, for Large Electron-Positron collider -- that is now in the circular tunnel to be occupied by the L.H.C. has been generating sketchy data hinting that it may already be seeing the Higgs. (That accelerator has its own set of four underground detectors, each much smaller than Atlas.)\nScientists on the experiments pleaded with the laboratory's management to delay the start of L.H.C. construction for a year so that they could either confirm or refute the evidence, but the request was ultimately turned down by CERN's director general, Prof. Luciano Maiani.\nThe decision not to change plans in order to chase one of the most important prizes in science has divided the worldwide physics community, which is already trying to form a consensus on what the successor to the L.H.C. might be -- probably a decades-long project that would require the participation of many countries.\n''Politically and scientifically, it's a tenuous time in our field in thinking about the future,'' said Dr. Howard Haber, a particle physicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\nQuickly determining the Higgs's existence and properties would give a powerful boost to that project, he said, as well as guiding physicists who are groping for a more encompassing theory of the cosmos than they have now. ''The benefits of the Higgs discovery would be enormous,'' Dr. Haber said.\nProf. Torsten Akesson, a physicist at Lund University in Sweden who is a deputy spokesman for Atlas, agreed that the evidence was consistent with what was expected from a Higgs detection. But he said that the evidence was sketchy enough to be a statistical fluke and that he favored moving ahead with the new machine.\nEven Dr. Gordon Kane, a particle theorist at the University of Michigan who expressed shock at the decision to close the machine, said the coming wave of discoveries could salve many wounds.\nHe said new particles beyond the Higgs could begin turning up at the Tevatron if an advanced but still speculative particle theory called supersymmetry is correct. The L.H.C. would then be able to probe more deeply into the predictions of supersymmetry, which seeks to erase lingering mysteries and inconsistencies in the established theory of the structure of matter, called the Standard Model.\n''It will be unbelievably exciting,'' Dr. Kane said, ''and just really an astonishing achievement for mankind. I really do think it will rather deeply affect people's view about the meaning of the world.''\nRecipe for Reality\nThe excitement begins with the Higgs and the Standard Model, a tried-and-true theory that has become the bedrock of particle physics over the last several decades.\n''Once upon a time, we understood very little about particle physics,'' said Dr. Alvaro de Rujula, a CERN theorist. ''That was prior to 1970,'' he said, referring to the years before the Standard Model began falling into place.\nThere are four known forces in nature: the strong force, which holds atomic nuclei together; the weak force, which causes radioactive decay; electromagnetism, a combination of electric and magnetic forces; and gravity.\nThe Standard Model encompasses all known particles as they interact via the first three forces; a separate formalism, Einstein's general theory of relativity, deals with gravity.\nThe model separates fundamental particles into three great classes: quarks and leptons, which are the subatomic building blocks of matter, and bosons. The bosons are the vehicles, or force carriers, by which all particles interact. For instance, photons, or particles of light, transmit the electromagnetic force, while particles called gluons transmit the strong force.\nQuarks and leptons differ in that only the former exchange gluons, allowing them to interact via the strong force. Both types of particles can feel electromagnetic and weak forces.\nWhile that distinction may sound abstract, it lets physicists account for all known matter in the universe. The strong force binds quarks together to create protons and neutrons, which collectively form the nuclei of atoms. Electrons, which are in the lepton family, orbit the nuclei to complete the atomic structure.\nOther known subatomic particles either fall into the lepton family or can be explained as different combinations of quarks.\nWhen tested against experiments, the predictions of the Standard Model ''turned out to be correct with a level of precision which is astonishing,'' Dr. de Rujula said.\nEven more impressive, the model is not simply a zoological arrangement of the particles. Within the model, their properties are largely determined by elegant though highly abstract principles involving mathematical symmetries.\nThere is at least one major glitch in this elegant picture. The preferred menu of particles predicted by this model, in its simplest and most symmetrical form, is one in which all particles are exactly the same and have zero mass.\nThat Last Building Block\nTo rescue the standard model from this absurd prediction, physicists have postulated an entity called the Higgs field, which breaks some of the symmetry and allows particles to have mass. The field exists as a well of energy permeating all of space and interacting by a sort of frictional or viscous force with particles; the greater the friction experienced by a given particle, the higher its mass. (The friction can also be thought of as the cause of the inertia of massive bodies.)\nThe energy cannot be detected directly, but physicists can use that friction to shake up the field and knock a new particle from it: the Higgs boson. The physicists do that by smashing together ordinary particles in accelerators.\nFor all its importance, the Higgs, which some theorists regard as an unattractive but unavoidable expedient, remains the last undetected particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model.\n''It's presumably the ugliest feature of the theory; it's also the most indispensable part,'' Dr. de Rujula said. ''It would help a lot if we found it.''\nThe precise mass of the Higgs is not predicted by the model. The higher its mass, the more powerful the accelerator required to create it. That is because Einstein's equation showing the equivalence of mass and energy allows the violence of collisions in the machine to be turned into a particle.\nThe hints from the existing CERN accelerator, LEP, suggest a Higgs that is light by physicists' standards, around 115 billion electron volts, or GeV. A proton weighs about 1 GeV.\nOnce created, the Higgs would live too briefly to be seen directly, so those hints consist of detections of the sprays of other particles it is thought to decay into.\nA Higgs of 115 GeV, or slightly heavier, would be just within the reach of the Tevatron. The L.H.C. could see Higgs particles all the way up to about 1,000 GeV.\nBut Wait, There's More\nAlas, for all the beauty and experimental success of the Standard Model, physicists know that it cannot be the end of the story. That is why they are sure they will bag something besides the Higgs in the new accelerators.\n''The Higgs would be the last building block of the Standard Model,'' said Dr. Joshua Frieman, a physicist at Fermilab and the University of Chicago. ''We have strong reason to believe that the Standard Model is not in itself a complete theory.''\nSome of those reasons are technical, some are aesthetic and some are both. On the aesthetic level, physicists are puzzled by the wildly differing strengths of the three forces in the model, each of which must be determined separately from experimental data, rather than fixed by some underlying principle. Physicists believe that at very high interaction energies, the forces should all merge, or unify, into a single universal force. But the Standard Model does not let them do that.\nThe same unattractive messiness turns up in the particle masses. While the Higgs mechanism does allow particles to have mass, each value has to be individually determined from experiments and plugged into the theory. Once again, there is no apparent pattern.\nAnd in a glaring shortcoming, all attempts to graft the fourth force, gravity, onto the Standard Model have failed. It seems very unlikely that two separate unrelated theories govern the universe.\nThe technical failings of the model are, if anything, even more painful for the quantitatively minded physicists. According to the weird rules of the subatomic quantum world, a particle like the Higgs spends part of its lifetime sharing its existence with other particles -- in essence, becoming other particles part of the time and picking up some of their mass. In the Standard Model, if all of those contributions were taken seriously and added up, the theoretical mass of the Higgs would explode beyond any reasonable value.\nTheoretical calculations show that this last failing is closely related to the ''hierarchy problem,'' the name physicists give to the unsolved question of why all four forces have such vastly different and unexplained strengths. The feebleness of gravity compared with all the others is especially problematical.\nFor all these reasons, said Dr. Carena of Fermilab, particle theorists ''are very much inclined to believe that there should be some new physics beyond the Standard Model.''\nOne possible extension, a theory called supersymmetry, has been studied intensively by Dr. Carena, Dr. Kane of the University of Michigan and many others. The theory predicts that each particle in the Standard Model has a yet-undiscovered partner that could appear as the new accelerators begin operating.\nThe particles, with whimsical names like squarks (partners of the quarks), selectrons (partners of the electrons) and gluinos (partners of the gluons), would exactly cancel their partners' exploding contributions to the calculated mass of the Higgs, restoring balance to the theory.\nAlthough it does not fully include gravity, supersymmetry also seems to allow for the possibility that the other three forces unify at high energies. ''Gluinos, winos, zinos, higgsinos,'' said Dr. Kane, listing some of the partners that could show up first. Winos and zinos (both rhyme with SEA-knows) are the partners of W and Z particles, which carry the weak force. The higgsino is the partner of the Higgs.\nSeeking Extra Dimensions\nSome physicists hope that an even more encompassing formalism called string theory will not only do all that supersymmetry does, but will also include gravity as well as predicting the strength of all the forces and the masses of the particles.\nThe mathematically arduous theory is still far from doing all that, but it has suggested a weird new possibility for taming the hierarchy problem that could have measurable experimental consequences.\nThe strings supposedly exist in 10 dimensions, and since our world apparently has only four dimensions, theorists speculate that entities related to the particles that are thought to carry the gravitational force could be created in the accelerators and speed away into the extra dimensions. That would leave behind a mysterious deficit of energy.\nThe attraction of extra dimension comes because theoretical calculations show they might solve part of the hierarchy problem.\n''Certainly the prospect of identifying a signal for these things at a collider is a great hope,'' said Dr. Lisa Randall, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and innovator in some of the theories.\nAt CERN, many of those hopes center on the two big detectors, including Atlas, which will be a barrel-shaped package of radiation-resistant wires, magnets, silicon and microelectronics 150 feet long when finished. It will have to sort out the debris from collisions occurring every billionth of a second and handle data rates roughly equivalent to the transmission of 20 simultaneous telephone conversations by every person on Earth.\nMoreover, while some of the parts are being assembled at CERN, said Dr. Ana Henriques Correia, a physicist who leads the construction of one section of the detector, most will arrive from far-flung laboratories around the world and then be lowered into the underground cavern for assembly. ''The engineering component of this experiment is much, much bigger than any experiment until now,'' she said.\nMr. Bachy, the Atlas chief engineer, says in the cavern that he appreciates the grand plans of the physicists to change humanity's perspective on the cosmos using the detector he is building. But when asked about his greatest worry for the project, he steers clear of advanced particle theories or new dimensions. ''Something which doesn't fit,'' Mr. Bachy said, glancing at the tunnel over his head."},

{"headline": null, "content": "''To determine ahead of time that such returns will be ignored, however, unless caused by some Act of God, is not the exercise of discretion. It is the abdication of discretion.''\nWith these concise words, a Florida circuit judge, Terry Lewis, instructed Secretary of State Katherine Harris yesterday on her duties under Florida law to drop her refusal to allow the late reporting of manually counted votes in counties where the presidential vote is disputed. In a carefully balanced decision, Judge Lewis upheld Ms. Harris's authority to call for initial reports from all 67 counties at 5 p.m. yesterday. Unfortunately, Ms. Harris, who seems intent on using her office to secure a victory for Gov. George W. Bush, quickly moved to complicate matters last evening.\nJudge Lewis warned her against using her authority in so arbitrary a way as to permit the delay of final vote tallies only in the case of an act of God, such as a hurricane. He said Ms. Harris should decide about delayed totals ''based upon a weighing and consideration of all attendant facts and circumstances.'' This was a clear reference to the extraordinary situation by which Florida's votes will decide whether Mr. Bush or Al Gore becomes president, and the ruling opened the way for counties that are doing a manual check of their vote totals to file updated reports later this week.\nBut in a disruptive development late in the day, a recalcitrant Ms. Harris directed those counties to explain by 2 p.m. today why the hand tabulations are necessary. The need for a fair count that the American people will accept as legitimate is obvious to everyone who has followed the Florida vote. Ms. Harris, who served as a co-chairwoman of the Bush campaign in Florida, may be maneuvering to rule that the manual counting is unjustified and in so doing cut short the exercise before Vice President Gore picks up additional votes. That would subvert the spirit of Judge Lewis's decision and undermine public faith that the outcome of the election has been fairly determined.\nThe judge's decision was a model of common sense and a rebuke to the partisan misreading of Florida statutes by Ms. Harris, who has blurred her twin responsibilities as chief arbiter of the state's election laws and her role as a Bush supporter. If all parties will respect it, the judge's ruling points to a path out of the battle over the validity of totals in those places where Mr. Gore is saying that the original machine count missed some of his ballots.\nA Bush spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, tried last night to put a favorable spin on Judge Lewis's words, suggesting erroneously that the preliminary results reported by all counties yesterday should be seen as final. It is true that the judge did sustain Ms. Harris's reading that yesterday marked the deadline. But in no uncertain language, he also said there really was no magic hour after which the manual counts may be ignored. He expressly allowed the counties to notify her of any pending returns and to file corrected returns when they were ready. Finally, the judge put Ms. Harris on notice that while she may reject a county's count, she cannot do so arbitrarily.\nIt would be a great antidote to the growing public disenchantment over this presidential wrestling match if the two campaigns would take a cue from Judge Lewis. That would involve former Secretaries of State James A. Baker III and Warren Christopher committing the Bush and Gore campaigns respectively to waiting for a hand count in Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and any other contested counties, and then abiding by the result once the absentee ballots due by Friday are added in this weekend.\nSuch an agreement would be in keeping with the national consensus that has emerged around completing the hand count as soon as possible, arriving at a comprehensive total and declaring a winner. The second part of the consensus is that everyone should stop filing lawsuits to impede the counting. Any effort by Ms. Harris now to stop the hand counting before it is completed would be peremptory and purely partisan. It would defeat Judge Lewis's responsible effort to insure that victory in Florida is not declared before all the votes are carefully and fairly counted. There should now be a hand count in any county, Republican or Democratic, where local officials feel one is warranted, and Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush should prepare the nation -- and themselves -- to accept the results."},
{"headline": null, "content": "ONE of my recurring disappointments has been the dismal state of New York's Indian restaurants. Although it is possible to ferret out food with the spicing, vibrancy and diversity that make Indian one of the world's glorious cuisines, a vast majority of restaurants, especially in Manhattan, settle for a dreary sameness. You would almost believe that the extent of Indian cooking is no more than what fits on a takeout menu.\nFor that reason alone, Mirchi, which opened about a month ago in Greenwich Village, deserves a warm welcome. It tries to break the imprisoning mold, and while its kitchen has been bedeviled by inconsistency, it succeeds often enough to for its failures to be forgiven.\nFrom its clean and simple design, it is clear that Mirchi is trying to set itself apart. Its casual service and loud Indian-by-way-of-London techno music suggest other youth-oriented restaurants with bar crowds rather than other Indian restaurants. Yet the food is strictly Indian, with not even a hint of fusion.\nThe focus is street foods and other small plates, a deceiving concept since many portions are quite large. Mirchi's other point of departure is forceful spicing, with occasionally very high heat (the word mirchi means hot, as in chilies). Sometimes this is done beautifully. Chicken tak-a-tak ($6), shredded chicken essentially stir-fried on the tawa (pronounced tav-AH), an Indian equivalent of a wok, was exceptional, with a peppery bite augmented by garlic, ginger and chili. Another night I had the same dish made with ground lamb, and it was no more than meat with chili heat, dull and one dimensional compared with the chicken.\nRagda pattice ($6), savory potato cakes topped with white beans, onions and chili, was another good dish, spicy but freshened with mint and cilantro. I loved mung jhinga chat ($7), grilled shrimp in a sweet-and-tangy tamarind sauce with an earthiness added by mung bean sprouts, while slivers of chicken breast tossed with onions, tomatoes and tamarind murgh chat ($5) was a well-balanced blend of sweet, salty and spicy.\nAs much as I liked these dishes, though, I couldn't help wondering if they would always be so good. One evening dhoklas ($4), steamed cakes of chickpea flour flavored with cilantro and chili, were bland and dry. Another night they were moist and light. Same with sev poori ($5), a crisp bread shell filled with potatoes, onions, chickpea vermicelli, yogurt and spices. Once it was made correctly and was delightful. Another time, the poori was too hard, and the filling was simply piled on top. Some dishes I won't willingly try again, like Koliwada maachi ($8), cubes of soft, watery salmon in an indistinct sauce.\nMain courses are just as inconsistent. Jaipuri lal maas ($15) is a fabulous and subtle lamb dish, made, the menu says, with 30 red chilies. Yet the chunks of lamb are not fiery but hauntingly spicy, as if the chilies had left a ghostly imprint of their power, capturing the full flavor of the pepper. Hyderabadi baingan ($12), baby eggplant in a creamy coconut and ginger sauce, achieves a perfect eggplant flavor without bitterness, while kicheri ($9), a rice and lentil dish that is to India what chicken soup is to New York, is exactly what I want next time I have a cold.\nI won't dwell on failures like a watered-down version of chicken in a black pepper sauce ($15) or fish in mustard sauce ($17), which was hard to distinguish from the chicken's black pepper sauce.\nOne feature you won't find at many moderately priced Indian restaurants is a wine list. It's a great idea, though Mirchi offers too many chardonnays and merlots, which are overwhelmed by spicy food.\nAt Mirchi, the ups outweigh the downs, and the potential for improvement is clear. For simply trying to tread a different path, I say thank you.\nMirchi\n29 Seventh Avenue South near Morton Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 414-0931.\nBEST DISHES: Chicken tak-a-tak, potato cakes with white beans, grilled shrimp in tamarind sauce, chicken chat, dhoklas, lamb with 30 chilies, eggplant in coconut and ginger sauce.\nPRICE RANGE: Appetizers, $4 to $9; main courses, $9 to $19.\nCREDIT CARDS: All major cards.\nHOURS: Lunch, Monday through Friday, noon to 3 p.m. Dinner, Sunday through Thursday, 5:30 to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday, 5:30 to midnight.\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESS: Everything is on one level."},

{"headline": null, "content": "In the gossipy world of contemporary art, if the price is right and the buzz before a sale is positive, the merchandise will move. And move it did at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art last night, an evening that brought 10 records and solid bidding.\nOn offer was consistently high-quality art from all periods -- everything from Abstract Expressionist and Pop art to some 1990's artists new to the auction rooms.\nOf the 62 lots, only 12 failed to sell. The sale totaled $43.1 million, right above its low estimate of $40 million.\nIt came as no surprise that the sale brought more than four times the total of Phillips's auction of contemporary art on Monday night. Sotheby's material was far superior, and so was its presentation.\nThe sale began with works of some younger artists, but most of the auction consisted of paintings, drawings and sculpture by established masters like Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Donald Judd.\nThe star work, Mark Rothko's ''No. 2 (Blue, Red and Green),'' from 1953, is a haunting abstract composition in soft shades of yellow, bright blue, green and crimson. Two buyers badly wanted to buy the painting, which sold to Robert Mnuchin, chairman of the Manhattan gallery C&M Arts, for $11 million, nicely above its estimate of $8 million to $10 million. After the sale Mr. Mnuchin said he had bought the painting on behalf of a ''major American collection,'' but he refused to be more specific.\nTonight, in its sale of postwar art, Christie's is offering Rothko's ''Untitled (White, Yellow, Red on Yellow),'' from 1953. That one is expected to fetch $15 million to $20 million.\nLast night's sale included 11 works being sold by the Lannan Foundation of Santa Fe, N.M., to benefit its acquisitions and projects in contemporary art. Since 1996 it has been giving its holdings to museums around the country, but this was the first time it had sold art to enhance its own programs. The results were mixed.\nAmong the best of the Lannan works up for sale last night were a group by Isamu Noguchi, including ''Cronos,'' a large standing piece in cast bronze from 1962. Estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, it sold for $643,750 to an unidentified bidder, a record price for the artist. A stronger price was paid for Kenneth Noland's ''Heat,'' (1958). One of the artist's famous target paintings, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $797,750, more than twice its high estimate of $350,000. Three bidders very much wanted Brice Marden's ''For Pearl,'' which brought $1.8 million. The price, just under its $2 million low estimate, nonetheless set a record for the artist.\n(Final prices include Sotheby's commission, 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000, and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)\nSculpture has been hugely popular this season, for several reasons; it is one area still undervalued, and many sculpture gardens are in formation around the country. When sculptures sold, they brought high prices.\nA monumental Calder, ''Stegosaurus,'' a bright red painted sheet-metal sculpture from 1972-73, was being sold by the trustees of the Ella Burr McManus Trust. Estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5 million, it sold for $4.1 million to James Cohan, a Manhattan dealer, and became the second highest priced work of the evening.\nAnother monumental Calder sculpture, ''Untitled'' (1963), nearly eight feet tall, was estimated at $800,000 to $1 million. It sold for $1.1 million to a telephone bidder. Andy Warhol also made a strong showing. ''Marilyn''(1962), a round gold portrait of Marilyn Monroe, had three bidders fighting it out up to $2.5 million. The painting sold for $2.7 million to a bidder so far in the back of the salesroom his paddle hard to see. The price was just above its $2.5 million high estimate.\nArshile Gorky's ''Khorkom'' (circa 1938), an abstract work intended to convey the artist's dreams of his childhood memories, was expected to sell for $1.8 million to $2.5 million. Several collectors vied for the painting, which sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.2 million..\nTwo works being sold by A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's largest shareholder and its former chairman, failed to sell. Francis Bacon's ''Study for a Portrait of Clive Barker'' (1987) was expected to bring $800,000 to $1.2 million, but bidding never went beyond $680,000. Nor was there any action on Mr. Taubman's Jasper Johns, ''Disappearance I,'' (1960), an encaustic and canvas collage in gray tones. It was estimated at $4 million to $6 million, but bidding stopped at $3.4 million. Mr. Taubman resigned from Sotheby's board in February after the federal antitrust investigation into price-fixing between Sotheby's and Christie's.\nWorks by several younger artists brought record prices. Robert Gober's ''Deep Basin Sink'' (1984), a sink fashioned from plaster, wire, enamel and semi-gloss paint, was expected to bring $500,000 to $700,000. It sold to Andrew Ruth, a Manhattan dealer for $830,750, a record for the artist. A Gober drawing of a sink brought another record, this time for a work on paper by the artist. It sold to Mr. Cohan for $55,950.\nEveryone at the sale seemed relieved after last week's poor showing in the Impressionist and modern auctions, knowing that the market for contemporary art is still very much alive. ''There still a lot people out there buying,'' said Irving Blum, a Los Angeles dealer. ''It's solid.''\nBut perhaps Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide and the evening's auctioneer, best summed up the evening. ''The estimates tonight were correct,'' he said. ''Everything sold at what it's worth in this market.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "The World Trade Organization has set a new date, in early December, to try to complete China's entry into the organization.\nNegotiators plan to meet on Dec. 5 through 8 in the hope of sealing China's entry either by the end of this year or sometime early in 2001.\nBefore it can become a member, however, China must iron out agreements with its trading partners in a number of crucial areas, including intellectual property rights.\nLong Yongtu, the Chinese negotiator, insisted that the agreement would be wrapped up during 2000.\n''Given the kind of atmosphere and momentum we have generated, it's very likely,'' he said at the conclusion of last week's negotiating round on China's accession terms.\nParticipants said the atmosphere, gloomy during the last round in September, was congenial and productive at the gathering, which took place from Wednesday to Friday.\n''China already has one foot in the place,'' said the W.T.O.'s deputy director general, Paul-Henri Ravier.\nThe amount of work still ahead, which includes synthesizing all of China's bilateral agreements into one comprehensive international accord, means, however, that the country might miss the goal of becoming a member by the end of the year.\nMr. Ravier, who is chairman of the talks, and Mr. Long said there was agreement on texts for accords in two crucial areas to assure foreign companies that China was complying with the organization's rules.\nThe first involves setting out rules for administering import tariffs, which cover the amount of goods that can be imported and the tariffs to be levied. The second accord covers procedures for independent judicial review of disputes involving foreign companies, providing explanations when import licenses are refused and uniform enforcement of the global trade rules across China.\nBesides intellectual property rights, other important areas, like agriculture and anti-dumping duties, must be settled. In Beijing, a United States assistant trade representative warned publicly last week that counterfeiting of products in China was ''out of control.'' In the mid-1990's, the two powers went to the brink of a trade war over such piracy until China signed an agreement pledging to tackle the proliferation of knock-offs of brand-name products.\nThe country also has yet to complete agreements on banking, insurance and other commercial services, which require changes in its domestic legislation. Showing the pressure Beijing is under, a team of Chinese bankers recently showed up unannounced in Switzerland, asking for guidance from Swiss banking officials for help in revamping their banking laws.\nDiplomats were relieved that the end was near for China's 14-year pursuit of W.T.O. membership, a process that has been snarled in internal and international politics. No sooner did the United States Congress grant permanent normal trade status to China in September than the W.T.O. talks broke down in angry exchanges and accusations. Mr. Long, who is China's vice trade minister, complained that China was being asked to concede more in the trade arena than other developing countries.\nIn unusually blunt remarks, the former chairman of the talks urged the governments of member countries to re-examine negotiating positions before resuming talks. After his remarks, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, went separately to Beijing to jump-start the talks.\nAlso helping to move things along was China's announcement that it had settled its differences over insurance licenses with the Europeans and completed bilateral talks with Bolivia, Costa Rica and Venezuela. That leaves Mexico the main country yet to conclude a nation-to-nation trade deal with China."},

{"headline": null, "content": "The Weyerhaeuser Company disclosed yesterday that it had made a $5.3 billion, $48-a-share cash offer to purchase Willamette Industries, setting the stage for a hostile takeover battle.\nWeyerhaeuser, the nation's third-largest forest products company, said it made its offer in a Nov. 6 letter from its chairman and chief executive, Steven R. Rogel, to Duane C. McDougall, Willamette's president and chief executive.\nWillamette's board met last week to consider the offer, but has not reached a decision.\nIn a letter on Sunday to William Swindells, Willamette's chairman, Mr. Rogel said that as a result of the board's failure to act, ''We are forced to assume that we must consider other alternatives to consummate a transaction.''\nThe offer that was disclosed yesterday is not the first time Weyerhaeuser has approached Willamette about a possible combination. The company said it held such discussions with Willamette two years ago.\nWillamette, based in Portland, Ore., said in a statement that its board continued to review the proposal, ''and will respond in due course.''\n''It is unfortunate that Weyerhaeuser chose to make its proposal public at this time,'' the statement added.\nWith the industry in the throes of consolidation, Wall Street analysts said the combination made good sense.\n''This is a great fit,'' said Linda Lieberman, a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns. ''It gives Weyerhaeuser a nice add-on in most of the businesses they are in.''\nInvestors reacted by sharply bidding up the price of Willamette's stock, which gained $11.06 a share, or 32 percent, closing at $45.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Weyerhaeuser, whose shares have been slumping since December, closed at $41.69, down $1.19.\nWeyerhaeuser's offer represents a 38 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $34.75 for Willamette's shares. In addition to the cash offer, Weyerhaeuser would assume $1.7 billion in Willamette debt.\nChip Dillon, a paper and forest products analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the bid, while attractive, might need to be sweetened to be accepted by Willamette shareholders. But Mr. Dillon also said a competing bid from another forest products company was unlikely.\n''There has never been a deal I have seen where all cards were put on the table at once,'' he said. ''Since at least 75 percent of Willamette's stock is in institutional hands, the company will have to come to the table. We are assuming that Weyerhaeuser will end up paying about $50 a share'' to complete the acquisition.\nMr. Dillon said that International Paper and Georgia Pacific, two potential bidders for Willamette, were busy absorbing companies they had recently purchased, and that European paper companies were not likely to express an interest.\n''I don't think you will see any other bidders emerge,'' he said. ''That is one reason Weyerhaeuser is being so bold.''\nMr. Rogel, who was the chief executive at Willamette before moving to Weyerhaeuser in 1997, said in a telephone interview that his company had lined up financing to pay for the acquisition.\n''This is a good value for Willamette shareholders,'' he said. ''We would hope their board will sit down and work on these issues. Working together, we can reach a conclusion rapidly.''\nMs. Lieberman of Bear, Stearns said that adding $7 billion in fresh debt to Weyerhaeuser's existing debt of about $5 billion would not put the company in a terribly difficult position.\n''As you are going into an economic slowdown, any debt is a burden,'' she said. ''But Weyerhaeuser has assets they could monetize if they wanted to take down debt fast. Would it be prudent to take down some debt immediately? Yes, it would be.''"},

He was 92 and had moved to Atlanta after retiring in 1974 as ambassador to the Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan.\nMr. McConaughy was one of the department's dwindling cadre of ''old China hands.'' Starting in 1941, he spent a large part of his career there, as well as in Washington, where he worked on assignments related to China in Washington.\nHe represented the United States in Pakistan in one of its many confrontations with India and flirtations with China. And he headed the embassy in 1960 in Seoul when South Korea shook off the grip of its authoritarian founder, Syngman Rhee, in a surge of riots.\nMr. Conaughy was born in Montevallo, Ala. He graduated from Birmingham-Southern College in 1928. In 1930, he was doing postgraduate work at Duke University and teaching high school in Brundidge, Ala., when he passed the Foreign Service examination and received an appointment.\nInitially, he was sent to Tampico, Mexico, as a vice consul. In 1933, he was transferred to Japan and worked for seven years in Kobe and Osaka, with brief spells in Taiwan and Nagasaki.\nEarly in 1941, he arrived in occupied Beijing. The Japanese interned him after they attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States declared war. Released in an exchange of diplomats, he wound up in the embassy at La Paz, Bolivia, for two years as commercial attache.\nHe had a posting in Rio de Janeiro and a year's study at the National War College before returning to China in 1948 as a consul and later consul general in Shanghai. By then, Mao's Communist army was closing in, the consulate was in a battle zone, and Shanghai fell in May 1949.\nMr. McConaughy stayed on for a year and closed the consulate in May 1950 as the last American Foreign Service outpost in China. The State Department gave him its Commendable Service Award for having protected American interests and rewarded him with a two-year assignment as consul general in Hong Kong.\nHe directed the Office of Chinese Affairs in Washington for five years before President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him ambassador to Burma, now Myanmar, in 1957, and ambassador to South Korea two years later.\nHe was back in Washington as assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern Affairs in 1961, when President John F.

{"headline": null, "content": "When it is time to choose a surgeon, given the choice between young and inexperienced and older and seasoned, most patients would probably choose the latter.\nBut for at least one procedure, a new study argues, they would be wrong.\nResearchers, writing in the September issue of the journal Neurology, report that when it comes to carotid endarterectomies -- operations in which plaque is removed from an artery in the neck to reduce the risk of stroke -- the longer a surgeon has been in practice, the worse the outcome.\nIndeed, wrote Dr. Liam O'Neill, an assistant professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell, for surgeons who received their licenses 20 or more years ago, the mortality rate for the procedure was about double that of surgeons with fewer than 20 years' experience. (About one in a hundred of the more experienced surgeons' patients died.)\nOne possible explanation: surgeons who have been in practice a long time may be reluctant to adopt procedural improvements, the researchers said. Or it may be that older surgeons rely too heavily on unseasoned medical residents.\nThe results, they said, lend weight to arguments that there should be independent audits of surgical results.\nCarotid endarterectomies have been on the rise as their effectiveness has been established. The study examined the results of 12,725 operations performed by 532 surgeons over two years in Pennsylvania.\nThe study also found that surgeons who did too few -- one operation a year or fewer -- had comparatively poor results."},

And though the fallopian method is costlier and riskier (because it can lead to ectopic pregnancies, in which the fetus develops outside the womb), it is still sometimes used because statistics show it is more effective, Dr. Palter said. The statistics are published by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.\nDr. Palter, clinic chief of reproductive medicine, presented his findings at a meeting of the reproductive society in San Diego.

{"headline": null, "content": "Dr. Linda Prine, a physician with a family practice in Manhattan, openly supports abortion rights. She has signs and buttons around her office saying so, and she tells her patients that she works one day a week at a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic.\nSo it may come as no surprise to Dr. Prine's patients that she plans to provide the newly approved abortion pill mifepristone, or RU-486. But patients may not expect the reaction they will get if they call her office and say they want a pill-induced abortion. Wary about abortion opponents, Dr. Prine plans to set up a system that she learned from doctors who provided mifepristone in clinical trials.\nShe explains how it will work: ''If a patient calls and says, 'I'm interested in getting a medical abortion,' the front desk staff says, 'Call this number.' They give a beeper number for me. I call the patients back on a cell phone that blocks caller ID. Then I screen the patients,'' she said.\nWhile Dr. Prine's scheme may seem reminiscent of the contortions doctors went through decades ago before abortions were legal, what makes her unusual is not so much her plan as the fact that she will offer mifepristone at all.\nAlthough the abortion pill's distributor, Danco Laboratories, says it will begin shipping the drug later this month, many private doctors say they still have no plans to offer it to their patients. That would leave it to abortion clinics to provide the pill. But many doctors at abortion clinics say they will advise their patients to choose a surgical abortion instead because they think surgery is a better method. Their decision to offer mifepristone, some say, is dictated more by competitive reasons than by their conviction that it is the best way to end a pregnancy.\nDoctors say they know that the situation is paradoxical. For abortion rights supporters who have waited for years for mifepristone, the drug's great promise was that it could take early abortions out of clinics, where women can be harassed and doctors threatened, and bring them to private doctors' offices. There, no one but a woman and her doctor would know that she had decided to terminate her pregnancy.\nAnd as soon as the Food and Drug Administration announced its approval of mifepristone in September, abortion rights advocates reported great excitement. Danco Laboratories said it had received hundreds of requests for order forms for the drug. Groups like the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood advertised their training sessions for doctors on how to use it. And abortion clinics and abortion rights advocates like Planned Parenthood say they have been swamped with calls from women asking about the pill.\nBut Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman, said most of the orders seemed to be from Planned Parenthood or independent abortion clinics. That is also the affiliation of most of the doctors attending National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood workshops, said Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the federation. And many of the women calling seem to be confused about what the pill does, thinking that they can swallow it at any stage of pregnancy and that their pregnancy will magically disappear.\nIn fact, a mifepristone abortion can be a lengthy ordeal, in contrast to a surgical abortion, which is over in minutes.\nThe Food and Drug Administration said mifepristone could be used to induce abortions only through seven weeks of pregnancy, dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period. After swallowing three mifepristone pills, the woman must return to her doctor's office two days later to take another drug, misoprostol, that makes the uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. Then she must come back again two weeks later to be sure the abortion is complete.\nThe drug combination causes bleeding and cramping that typically lasts 9 to 16 days, but it is about 95 percent effective in completely aborting a pregnancy. If the drugs fail, the woman must have a surgical abortion.\nWhile in theory, at least, any licensed doctor could offer mifepristone, many say now that they have no intention of doing so and others say they will try to avoid providing the drug.\nFor example, a family practice doctor in Maine, who asked not to be identified, said he was so committed to providing abortions that he secretly worked nights at an abortion clinic in another town 40 miles away. He said he would offer mifepristone at that clinic. But if one of his regular patients asks for the drug, he does not plan to provide it. And, he said, his partner in his family practice as well as the other doctors in his town are not interested in providing it either.\n''The greater good that I do is the abortion work I do out of town,'' the doctor explained. ''My first obligation is to those patients. If I were to offer mifepristone in my office, and risk picketing, that would compromise what I regard as my important abortion work elsewhere.''\nDr. Steven Tamarin, a New York doctor in family practice, also applauds the approval of mifepristone. A member of the board of directors of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, an organization of about 2,000 doctors who promote abortion rights, Dr. Tamarin said he was not worried about abortion opponents. But he has another concern: the time it takes to provide a mifepristone abortion. The drug agency requires that the women be counseled about the pill before using it.\n''There's no extra payment for doing the counseling,'' Dr. Tamarin said. But there also is an abundance of abortion clinics in Manhattan where women should be able to get the pill, he said.\n''If a patient comes to me,'' he said, ''and says, 'Doctor, I'm really uncomfortable going anywhere else. I'm terrified. I trust you. Would you please provide the medical abortion?' I would certainly do it. But if there's 10 people around the corner who do it and I'm up to the gills in other things, then I might not go out of my way looking for more work.''\nDoctors point to other obstacles as well. One is deciding how far along a pregnancy is, since mifepristone can be used only within the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Another involves making sure that the fetus is in the uterus and not in a fallopian tube.\nThe way to check on an early pregnancy is with intravaginal ultrasound, a method widely available at abortion clinics, but not in most private doctors' offices. The Hope Medical Group for Women, an abortion clinic in Shreveport, La., spent $27,000 on a machine, said Robin Rothrock, the clinic's administrator. And even if a doctor bought one for mifepristone abortions, ''you've got the issue of making sure they know what they are doing,'' she said.\n''Few of these doctors in every hamlet, village and town who are supposed to make medical abortions so widely available have ultrasound equipment or the expertise to use it,'' said Dr. William West, who runs an abortion clinic in Dallas. ''They are not going to acquire such expensive equipment to enable them to do a few medical abortions that won't come close to paying for it,'' he added.\nThe F.D.A. also requires that any doctor who provides mifepristone be able to provide a surgical abortion in case mifepristone fails or to have an agreement with another doctor or an abortion clinic that can provide a surgical abortion. Abortion clinics would be a logical choice for such backup agreements, doctors say. But clinic doctors say they have not heard from doctors who want their services.\n''We have not been called by anybody about surgical backup and we are the only clinic in the Pacific Northwest that's been using mifepristone since the first trials,'' said Dr. Deborah Oyer, medical director and owner of Aurora Medical Services in Seattle. ''We have gotten lots of calls over the years about medical abortions. We have done seminars on medical abortions and we have had tons of phone calls from the lay public and potential patients. But I don't know of any doctors calling about surgical backup or about how to get started,'' Dr. Oyer said.\n''I'm a little surprised,'' she said. ''But also at some level, I'm not. In studies that were done in the last several years, there were always a significant percent of doctors who say they would do medical abortions. But I was always a little suspicious. It's a lot easier to say you'll do it than to actually do it.''\nIn addition, Dr. Oyer said, many women do not want their doctor -- or anyone in their town -- to know they had an abortion. ''I can't tell you how many women who come on their own say, 'Oh, I can't tell my doctor,' '' Dr. Oyer said. ''And sometimes their doctor is someone who does abortions in their own office.''\nMs. Rothrock said she too had not received any calls from private doctors for backup services. Her clinic, she said, is one of only two that provide abortions in a 200-mile radius, and the other clinic has decided not only that it will not provide backups but that it will not even provide mifepristone. Its owner, Roneal Martin, said his doctors did not have time to be on call for the patients 24 hours a day. Even so, Ms. Rothrock said, she was not sure she would want to help private doctors whose mifepristone patients needed surgical abortions.\n''It comes down to taking over someone's complications,'' she said. ''Does that mean I'm putting my doctor on call in the middle of the night. We might say, 'Go to the emergency room.' ''\nDr. Warren Hern, director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado, worries about that, too. ''What's going to happen if the emergency room doctor takes care of the patient and perforates the uterus?'' he asked. ''Who's responsible?''\nSome say that the driving force that will bring mifepristone to private doctors' offices will be women who demand it.\n''This will not be physician driven; it will be patient driven,'' said Dr. Carole Joffe, a visiting professor of sociology at Bryn Mawr College, outside Philadelphia.\nAnd all agreed that women seemed interested in the drug.\nVicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion Federation, said so many women were calling about mifepristone that the group had to double the capacity of its hot line. ''We get over 3,000 calls a month, and it's increasing,'' she said.\nGloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said her organization's clinics had been deluged with calls. ''We're taking tens of thousands of calls here,'' she said.\nDoctors at abortion clinics also say they have been inundated with calls from women who are interested in mifepristone. But the problem, they say, is that most of these women are confused about what the drug does.\n''They think that no matter how far along you are in a pregnancy, you just swallow a pill and that's it,'' said Dr. West, the operator of the Dallas abortion clinic.\n''There's a very common misconception in the lay public, and even way too common among physicians, that this is a nice, easy way to get rid of a pregnancy,'' said Dr. William Ramos, who runs an abortion clinic in Las Vegas.\nMany abortion providers say they tell women that a pill-induced abortion is an option, but that surgery is faster and less painful and requires one visit to the clinic rather than three. ''We're telling them straight up front that if any of us needed an abortion, we'd go for the surgical procedure,'' Dr. Ramos said.\nDr. West said that he would offer mifepristone, but that he was not happy about it because he thought surgery was much better. ''I'll be forced by market pressures to offer it,'' he said.\nDr. Charles Livengood, a gynecologist at Duke University who provides abortions there, also said he preferred surgical abortions.\n''I think it's good to have mifepristone available,'' Dr. Livengood said. ''But I do think that an abortion with mifepristone tends to be a prolonged and messy affair as opposed to a quick procedure that I do in the clinic.'' Nonetheless, he has been dutifully presenting it as a possibility to his patients, explaining carefully what taking the drug entails.\n''I've presented it to 10, maybe 12 women,'' Dr. Livengood said. ''I haven't had any takers at this point.''"},

Surgery can save lives but carries risk.\nEach year, about 30,000 Americans suffer ruptured aneurysms, lesions that researchers think form from the stress of blood flow or, sometimes, because of connective tissue disease.\nBut not all aneurysms rupture.

{"headline": null, "content": "Federal officials today placed the wild Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers on the endangered species list, saying the fish faced threats from their farm-bred brethren and other factors that put them on the brink of extinction.\nThe decision makes it a federal violation to 'take' salmon in the Maine rivers -- that is, to harm, capture or even try to catch the fish -- and it brought strenuous objections from Maine's governor, Angus King, who argued that it was based on questionable science and warned that it could ruin the state's fish-farming and blueberry industries.\nMaine's United States senators protested as well, calling the decision heavy-handed and saying the state already had an extensive program to save the salmon.\n''All this listing guarantees is that more money will be spent on the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and less money on actually restoring the salmon population,'' the Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins, said in a joint statement.\nBut the decision brought some applause from conservationists, mixed with continued concern.\nThe listing ''is an important step, but it also just reaffirms in everyone's mind how fragile the last remaining runs of Atlantic salmon are in the United States,'' said Bill Taylor, president of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a nonprofit group that promotes the conservation of wild salmon. ''When you're down to counting the returning salmon on your fingers and toes, it's pretty scary.''\nPeople on both sides of the Atlantic salmon question agree that the fish, once plentiful in New England's rivers, are in the deepest of trouble. And some of the causes are also undisputed, and decades old: fishing, pollution, habitat changes. Efforts to help the salmon by stocking the Maine rivers where they run began more than 100 years ago, and more than $5 million in federal money has been allocated for Atlantic salmon conservation in the current fiscal year.\nBut so far, the salmon have continued to dwindle, to the point that government officials reported today that at last count just 27 adult salmon had returned to the eight Maine rivers that the listing affects: the Dennys, East Machias, Machias, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Ducktrap and Sheepscot rivers along with Cove Brook. Other points remain in dispute, however. The federal decision specified that scientists had determined that the Maine salmon were a genetically distinct group; Maine officials contend that the salmon could not possibly be considered a distinct group.\n''After you restock the rivers with 100 million salmon over the course of a century, how could they possibly argue that the river isn't full of hybrids?'' asked John Ripley, Governor King's spokesman. The governor had asked the Department of Interior to wait on a listing until a National Academy of Sciences study of the salmon could be completed six months from now. Instead he received assurances that the listing could be revoked if the study's results merited it, Mr. King said today.\nThere is also dispute over the extent to which the wild salmon are hurt by the proximity of their farm-bred counterparts, who are raised in ocean pens, many not far from the mouths of the rivers.\nGovernment officials said today that serious diseases had been detected in farmed salmon in Canada and Massachusetts, and they were concerned the diseases could spread to the wild Maine salmon. The officials also cited concerns that the wild salmon would interbreed with farmed salmon, producing progeny that would be ill-suited for survival.\nJoseph McGonigle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, challenged those arguments, saying that disease generally passed from wild fish to farm fish, not the reverse and that there had been virtually no documented cases of farmed fish interbreeding with wild fish.\nIt remains to be seen, Mr. McGonigle said, how the decision will affect Maine's $75-million-a-year aquaculture industry, which competes heavily with foreign producers. The immediate effect for blueberry growers and fish farmers is that they can now be subject to much more stringent regulation. For example, blueberry growers might be required to draw less water for irrigation.\nMr. Ripley said today that Governor King had not yet decided how to respond to the listing decision and was considering whether to appeal it in federal court."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Gillian Costello is a lawyer. Proof is important to her. So yesterday, to show a reporter something on the subway, she conducted a simple empirical demonstration.\nMs. Costello had absolutely no doubt about the outcome of her experiment, because she tests this particular hypothesis twice every workday. As do most women in New York, whenever they manage to get a seat on a crowded train. The hypothesis: Men take up a lot more room on the subway than women. They stretch out. They lean. They do the Ward Cleaver ankle-on-knee leg cross. But mostly, and most damnably, they tend to sit with their legs splayed out like catchers behind home plate.\nAnd sitting next to them will invariably be a woman like Ms. Costello -- knees clamped together, shoulders hunched, bag on lap and newspaper folded into a thin column, hiding a face with the pained expression peculiar to someone who is being touched by a total stranger over long periods of time.\nThe demonstration began yesterday morning at 9:30 at the Bergen Street station in Brooklyn, where Ms. Costello, 35, catches the No. 2 train every morning. Crowding in the cars was light, and Ms. Costello got lucky, wedged between a woman and what seemed to be an anomalous man, his feet only shoulder-width apart.\nBut before the train had gone two stops, she spotted several grievous examples of what she was talking about. ''Look at that guy,'' she said, pointing toward a small man wearing a backpack the size of a compact car. The man sat down with the backpack still on, ramming it into several people. And then, as if he had not made his presence sufficiently felt, he butterflied his knees into the passengers on both sides.\nMs. Costello shook her head. ''He's guilty of several offenses,'' she said.\nNext was the very, very big guy down the bench with the black beret and the flowing beard who was not only spread-eagled but sound asleep and swaying from side to side.\nThen there was the young guy sitting on a two-person bench at the end of the car. His elbows were on his knees and his knees were spread out so far that no one even tried to sit next to him.\n''That's not just invading space,'' Ms. Costello said, framing her arguments carefully, as if for a judge. ''That's foreclosing on it altogether.''\nWhen the topic of the Encroaching Male is raised among women at her law firm or at a party, Ms. Costello says, it becomes a kind of rallying cry. It ranks high on the list of subway irritants, up there with people who stand in the door, people who push into the train before letting others off and people who lean their entire bodies against the pole (making it impossible for anyone else to use it to hang on).\nBut these other offenses sometimes cross gender lines. Space invasion, on the other hand, tends to be one in which women are without sin and so can freely cast some stones.\nThere are several theories about why it happens, all of them gross generalizations. Women sit with their legs together more often because they are wearing skirts or because they were taught that sitting that way is more becoming. Men sit the way they sit because they think keeping their legs together looks prim or because they are compelled by a primordial instinct left over from the days when they sat on tree limbs and had to make themselves look bigger so something would not come along and eat them.\nMs. Costello, on this point: ''It does tend to be the leaner guys who spread themselves out even more.''\nOf course, there are always exceptions, like the large woman in the leopard-print pants sitting next to Ms. Costello on the C train, whose knee spread beat all the men on the seat. But exceptions are rare.\nEven rarer is the man who will admit he is guilty of the offense.\nEugene Lareau, a 56-year-old messenger, was one of the men who impinged -- albeit only slightly -- on Ms. Costello's space yesterday. As she left the train, a reporter asked Mr. Lareau what he thought about her complaint.\n''I don't know why people do that,'' he said, oblivious to the fact that he had just done it himself. ''I guess the subway brings out the worst in people.''"},

The stay will give the prosecution and defense time to prepare for the state's appeal of the dismissal of attempted murder charges against the two men.\nJudge Andrew J. Smithson of Superior Court said at a hearing today that both sides wished to prepare for the state's appeal before going to trial on the remaining charges against Troopers John Hogan and James Kenna. Those charges are that they falsified their arrest records to conceal what the state calls evidence that they had singled out minority motorists for traffic stops.\nThe two officers still face a federal inquiry that could lead to charges that they violated the civil rights of three black and Hispanic men they wounded during the shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998. The troopers pleaded self-defense, arguing that the van they had stopped was backing up and attempting to run them down.\nBut the state, under intense criticism for revelations that state police had made it a practice to single out minority drivers, filed attempted murder charges against the troopers, as well as accusing them of falsifying state records.\nOn Oct. 31, Judge Smithson dismissed the attempted murder charges with a blistering attack on state prosecutors and particularly former Attorney General Peter G. Verniero, now a State Supreme Court judge. Judge Smithson said that the murder indictments were politically tainted and that the state had prejudiced the grand jury that handed up the indictments of the two.\nFollowing the dismissal, Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. asked federal prosecutors to consider civil rights charges against the two.\nThe lawyers for the two troopers expressed satisfaction today that the trial on the remaining charges against the troopers had been put off until Jan. 11.\nBut Jack Arseneault, the lawyer for Trooper Kenna, lamented the prospect of having to fight at both the state appellate level and in federal court.\n''I'd feel a lot better today if we could deal with this in one jurisdiction,'' Mr. Arseneault said after Judge Smithson's action. ''It would be better if we could just deal with this matter with just the feds.''\nPhilip DeVencentes, Trooper Hogan's lawyer, said he expected to win whether in state or federal court.\n''It doesn't matter who looks at this case,'' he said, ''because ultimately it's going to be determined that that this was something that should never have been the basis for indictments.''\nBoth lawyers repeated their long-held positions that the two troopers would not consider plea bargains.\nJames J.

Mom is usurping your turf.\nJenny Crawford, Cindy's 53-year-old mother, is one of six parents of celebrity children featured in a new exercise video, ''Power Pilates,'' with the actress Stefanie Powers. Released last month, the video is aimed at an older generation of Americans that is more interested in countering the effects of osteoporosis and arthritis than achieving buns of steel or rippled abs.\nAppearing in the video are members of Silver Foxes, a group of celebrity parents who came together in the mid-1980's to promote more active, healthier lives for people 50 and over.\nThere is Christine Johnson, Magic's mom; Patsy Swayze, Patrick's mom; Nikki Robbins, Tony's mom; Sal Pacino, Al's dad, and Tony Tarantino, Quentin's dad.\nLooking and moving like the dancer she is, Ms. Powers offers instructions and insight into the basic exercise techniques developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 1900's. ''Power Pilates'' is billed as a floor-movement program designed to produce leaner, stronger and more efficient muscles by concentrating on body alignment, muscle balance, flexibility and body control; it uses breathing patterns to help oxygenate muscles while exercising.\n''We are as strong as our weakest link,'' said Ms. Powers, who was in New York recently with Silver Fox members to promote the video. ''By connecting a movement pattern through the body, we strengthen our smaller muscles to support our larger muscle groups.''\nThe Foxes come in all shapes and sizes. Unlike the leotard-clad Ms. Powers, they have come ready to work out in T-shirts and sweats, managing to alternate from one movement to the next with little or no strain. It is clear from the outset that this will not be one of those music-thumping, highly charged exercise routines. The necessary props are a chair, a mat and a towel.\n''After the first class, I thought I'd be too sore to participate in the next,'' said Mrs. Johnson, 64. ''But I was surprised. I didn't feel sore at all.''\nThroughout the program, Ms. Powers moves about the room offering advice.\n''I'm 78,'' said Mr. Pacino, who looks 20 years younger and knows it. ''I suffer from bursitis, arthritis and tendinitis. One week after doing Power Pilates, I noticed that I wasn't as stiff in the joints.''\nThe old image of gray-haired seniors doing needlework and crossword puzzles is giving way to a fit, active older generation.\n''People today my age think younger,'' Mrs. Crawford said.

{"headline": null, "content": "With its bare face, belly and legs, the Gulf Coast native sheep of Florida, Georgia and Louisiana looks perpetually half-shorn, like a parody of a show poodle. But to many animal scientists, this odd creature represents a living piece of early American history that may help improve the sheep industry in the Southeast.\nDirectly descended from the stock of the first Spanish and French colonists, the sheep represents ''a classic case of survival of the fittest,'' said Dr. J. Marcos Fernandez, professor of animal science at Louisiana State University, which maintains the largest existing flock of the animals. Breeding largely free of human intervention for more than 300 years, the sheep has adapted to the heat and humidity of the Gulf of Mexico coast and developed resistance to a number of diseases and parasites that debilitate other breeds.\nScientists are particularly interested in the sheep's immunity to the barber pole worm, a potentially lethal gastrointestinal parasite that has itself become resistant to commercial deworming medication.\n''Researchers are trying to identify the gene responsible and find a way to introduce it into breeds of British origin, which are important for the lamb and wool industries, to make them parasite-resistant,'' Dr. Fernandez said.\nHe recently observed that some Gulf Coast native sheep developed Type 2 diabetes but remain asymptomatic, a discovery that might help experts better understand the disease in humans and animals.\nDespite its importance, the Gulf Coast native sheep is one of 1,000 to 1,500 breeds of livestock considered at risk of extinction around the world, according to the World Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity, compiled by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. That estimate, described as conservative, represents about 30 percent of some 4,000 to 5,000 breeds from 28 domesticated species of birds and mammals.\nOver the past 10,000 years, humans have domesticated about 40 species and created many thousands of breeds. For its survey, the agricultural organization focused on the 28 most significant of them, including horses, donkeys, cattle, camels, sheep, goats, swine, chickens, geese, Japanese quail, ducks and turkeys.\nIn addition to serving human needs, experts say those animals represent an important reservoir of genetic diversity, play a significant role in shaping a number of ecosystems, and are central to the history and culture of many communities.\nYet more than 600 breeds of livestock have already vanished, the organization estimates, and another 78 are lost each year. Experts attribute the losses to the growing industrialization of agriculture to meet rising demand around the world, particularly for poultry, pork and dairy cows; replacement of draft animals with machines; ''indiscriminate'' crossbreeding in an effort to improve indigenous stock; a narrow focus on certain breeds, like the Holstein for milk, to the exclusion of others; war and natural disasters; loss of family farms; and changing tastes in food and fashion.\nThus, for example, after the collapse of the market for mohair in the 1990's, the population of angora goats, which produce it, plummeted in this country as farmers turned to other breeds.\nThe sheer size and complexity of the problem is daunting, said Dr. David R. Notter, professor of animal science at Virginia Tech and a frequent consultant to the organization. The question is how to protect the genetic diversity of livestock breeds.\nPart of the answer lies in determining which breeds are genetically and culturally unique, according to many experts. To help in making that determination, biologists draw distinctions between indigenous breeds that have evolved to match local conditions and ''refined'' or ''improved'' breeds, usually from the industrialized world.\nThe modern concept of ''breeds'' developed in Europe and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries when people began selectively breeding animals for specific traits, including coat color, size, and egg, milk or meat production. With their narrowed range of genetic variability, those ''improved'' breeds eventually supplanted nearly all indigenous stock here and in Europe.\nIn the 20th century, selective scientific breeding intensified and produced animals that were vastly better in specialized areas than others. Industrial hens bred purely to lay eggs will produce as many as 300 a year, experts say, compared with 20 to 30 for most indigenous birds. Industrial broiler chickens bred for meat will mature in 6 to 7 weeks, as opposed to 12 weeks for traditional stock. And the pork industry has developed pigs that mature earlier and produce leaner meat than their unrefined cousins.\nSince the mid-1960's, using intensive selection, artificial insemination and, more recently, embryo implantation, breeders and animal scientists have succeeded in doubling milk production in Holsteins, the world's top-producing dairy cow, said Dr. Les Hansen, professor of animal science at the University of Minnesota.\nBut scientists worry that the level of inbreeding used to attain those results is reducing genetic diversity within breeds. That reduction can, if unchecked, lead to health problems. They also worry that breeders will lack the ability to respond to changing tastes.\nDr. Hansen has calculated that the eight million Holsteins in this country represent, in effect, the descendants of 37 individuals, a figure derived by calculating the degree of inbreeding among all animals. Although the breed still possesses a remarkable level of internal genetic variability, he said, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases and fertility problems associated with inbreeding are becoming more common.\nAs farmers have shifted their attention to top producing animals to maximize profits and as industrialized agriculture has replaced family farms, many minor breeds created in the last 200 years have vanished, said Dr. Donald E. Bixby, executive director of the nonprofit American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. Others survive in small numbers and, although experts believe the genetic variation between many ''improved'' breeds is slight, they are reluctant to let them perish for fear of losing important mutations.\n''We have to preserve genetic diversity between breeds and maintain genetic diversity within breeds,'' said Dr. Harvey Blackburn, coordinator of the National Animal Germ Plasm Program, established in 1999 in the Department of Agriculture.\nThe goals of the program, he said, are to create a national center for preservation of sperm, eggs and embryos in Fort Collins, Colo.; to study the genetic differences between breeds; and to compile a data bank of livestock breeds.\nMany observers contend the federal program lags behind those in Western Europe and does little to conserve living populations of imperiled breeds, leaving that effort to groups like the livestock conservancy, individuals and universities that maintain animals for research.\n''Most people are beginning to realize that you need living animals walking around and not just frozen genetic material,'' Dr. Bixby said.\nCryopreservation, or freezing of the material, is not even a viable option for poultry, said Dr. Mary E. Delany, assistant professor of animal science at the University of California at Davis, because only semen can be successfully frozen using current technology. ''You're saving only the male half,'' she said. ''How are you going to use that to reconstitute the whole bird?''\nBy far the greatest potential losses of genetic diversity are in developing nations, where imported livestock often supplants indigenous breeds and damages the environment. The importation of industrial chickens has become so pervasive that in many areas, the traditional barnyard bird is in danger of disappearing, Dr. Notter said. But industrial birds require high quality feed and lack disease and parasite resistance, the ability to avoid predators and the instinct to incubate their eggs.\n''Policy makers looking at long-term improvement in livestock might be better off improving native breeds than bringing in outside breeds,'' Dr. Notter said. ''That way they can synchronize the animals with their environment, and that would go a long way toward preserving breeds.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "Patti LuPone's evening of song, ''Matters of the Heart,'' is being performed in the lofty grandeur of the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, but it creates the sedate atmosphere of a salon. The lush green backdrop curtain, the elegant flower bowl perched on the piano, Ms. LuPone's de la Renta gowns and her formally attired accompanists -- a pianist, Dick Gallagher, who is also the arranger and musical director, and a string quartet -- all contribute to an intimate formality that the music never disturbs and never tries to.\nThe program, taken largely from Ms. LuPone's CD of the same title that was released last year, is devoted to the theme of love and its corollaries. The songs, from writers like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Stephen Sondheim, Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell, are a pleasant mixture of classics, show tunes and pop songs bespeaking full or empty hearts, spiced occasionally by a mischievous twitch of the loins.\n''I think everyone in the theater has been in love,'' Ms. LuPone says in her introductory patter, which gives you an idea of the sweetly unchallenging nature of the show, which opened yesterday and will be presented Sundays and Mondays through Dec. 17.\nMs. LuPone has generous and varied gifts as a singer. Her voice has the capability of bringing down a Broadway house, but she is largely in delicate mode here, the brass of her persona evident mostly when she sings about the wicked impulses of lust or the sly manipulations of courtship.\nShe brings a nice touch of the bawdy to a suggestive lyric, as in Mr. Sondheim's ''I Never Do Anything Twice.'' And her experience as a stage actress, both dramatic and comic, enlivens a handful of conversational songs. ''Playbill,'' by John Bucchino, about two strangers meeting at a bar after a show and, they hope, entering a courtship, is delicate, tense and touching. On the other hand, Ms. LuPone delivers Dillie Keane's ''Shattered Illusions,'' a jaunty comic confessional about what one expects from a lover and then what one gets, with an understated vaudevillian charm.\nOne reason these stand out is that most of Ms. Lupone's selections here have sincerity at the center, a spirit that is unabashedly underscored by Mr. Gallagher's saccharine arrangements. As a singer, Ms. LuPone is not necessarily averse to the overly somber meaningfulness of bubble-gum pop; she does have a whiff of the self-important diva in her. In songs like Gilbert O'Sullivan's ''Alone Again (Naturally)'' and ''Air That I Breathe'' by Albert Hammond and Michael Hazelwood, the treacle factor gets a little wearing, and the show as a whole evokes an uncomplicated and rather polite sentimentality.\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing, and, particularly as the holidays loom, to quibble over too much sentiment is a bit unseemly. In the end, ''Matters of the Heart'' is not a show for Scrooge, and though it isn't a holiday show, it exudes the melancholy hopefulness of New York at Christmas, the sense of walking through Rockefeller Center alone at dusk in the freezing cold.\nWhen Ms. LuPone closes the evening with ''Hello, Young Lovers'' and ''My Best to You,'' it makes you want to hold someone's hand.\nMATTERS OF THE HEART\nConceived and directed by Scott Wittman; musical direction and arrangements by Dick Gallagher; additional dialogue by John Weidman; lighting by John Hastings; sound by Mark Fiore; production supervisor, Richard Hester; hair and makeup by Danielle Vignjevich; general manager, Steven C.

{"headline": null, "content": "Doctors may soon be able to rejuvenate weakly pumping hearts by creating brand-new muscle and blood vessels fashioned from cells scavenged elsewhere in patients' bodies, new research suggests.\nThe idea is to repair the hearts of people with congestive heart failure, a condition that afflicts nearly five million Americans, by recreating heart tissue damaged by heart attacks and the wear and tear of aging.\nSeveral new reports on this approach were presented today at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association. Although most of the research is still being done in animals, French researchers described one attempt to patch a man's heart using muscle gathered from his thigh.\n''This is incredibly exciting new science,'' said Dr. Rose Marie Robertson of Vanderbilt University, the association's president.\nHeart failure occurs when damage to the heart muscle weakens the organ's power to pump blood forcefully enough.\nAlthough medicines can help, many victims suffer crippling shortness of breath, lack of stamina and swelling of the legs.\nIn the French case, made public last month, doctors treated a 72-year-old man with severe heart failure from a heart attack, which left his main pumping chamber scarred and disabled.\nUnder local anesthesia, the doctors removed a bit of muscle from his thigh, then grew it in the laboratory to create millions of contracting cells called skeletal myoblasts. On June 15, they transplanted 800 million of these cells with a needle into and around the heart scar.\nDr. Philippe Menasche of Bichat Hospital in Paris said that there had been a striking improvement in the man's condition, and that the new tissue in his heart was contracting rhythmically. But the man also received a coronary bypass, so doctors could not be sure how much of his change was due to the transplant.\n''We repopulated the dead scar with living cells,'' Dr. Menasche said. ''These are encouraging results, but we have to be very, very, very cautious.'' The French doctors hope to repeat the experiment on eight more patients over the next year.\nTwo other approaches have been tried only in lab animals, but doctors say they could offer an important advantage: the new tissue will be real heart material, not transplanted skeletal muscle as the French used.\nDr. Ray C. J. Chiu of McGill University in Montreal reported on the use of immature bone marrow tissue called marrow stromal cells. These have the ability to transform into many different body parts, including nerves and liver as well as heart. His team injected marrow stromal cells in the hearts of 22 genetically identical rats. Dr. Chiu said the new tissue quickly began to work with the original heart cells, beating in unison.\nIn Boston, Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Hospital used a similar approach to help hearts grow new blood vessels. Arteries are constructed from tissue called endothelial cells. Immature versions of these cells circulate in the bloodstream. Using rats, researchers gathered these immature endothelial cells, grew them in test tubes to make millions of copies and then injected them into the areas of damaged heart muscle. The animals' hearts grew new blood vessels and appeared to work better than hearts without the treatment."},

His nearest rival, Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, trailed with 17 percent.\nThe Serb Democratic Party is also leading in the Parliament of the Serb Republic and for the Serbian seats in the federal Parliament.\nIn the Muslim-Croat Federation, the other entity that makes up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union, was just ahead of the Muslim party of former President Alija Izetbegovic, the Party of Democratic Action, for the federation and national assemblies. The multiethnic Social Democratic Party was third.\nThe Social Democratic Party, which Western officials had hoped would make big gains, appears to have failed to improve on its showing in April in local elections.\nDiplomats and elections officials said with so few votes counted and because of the large number of ballots cast by displaced people inside and outside Bosnia, it was too early to draw conclusions."},
{"headline": null, "content": "As I walked through the local airport last week, a baggage handler recognized me and shouted: ''If these two guys can't get together and solve this mess, neither deserves to be president.''\nWhile his view might not be a realistic solution for the nation, the handler was right about the need for the candidates to take control and agree on some sort of process that will bring closure to this election.\nIn a very real way, the first test of whether Al Gore or George W. Bush can be an effective president of the United States is now, not the day after the inauguration. So far, both have allowed their campaign organizations to engage in continuing campaigns to convince the public of the fairness of their positions. Deploying lawyers, spokesmen and campaign managers this way may satisfy the appetite to fight, but not the responsibility to reconcile a serious national dilemma.\nNo one disputes that this is a unique and challenging moment in our history. To have a national election of over 100 million votes come down to a few hundred controversial ballots in Florida is without precedent. It is understandable that both campaigns, having fought long and hard for their candidates, want to do whatever it takes to get the very last votes they need to win. But while a scorched-earth litigation process to the bitter end may make sense to the lawyers and the campaign officials, does it make sense for the nation?\nIt is obvious that the United States is deeply divided over who should win. Aggravating those differences in a bitter post-election battle will only make it that much more difficult for the winner to govern.\nAfter the federal court decision not to interfere with Florida law, both candidates now face a crucial choice. They could continue to litigate each election decision that is not acceptable, challenging close votes not only throughout Florida but in Wisconsin, Iowa, New Mexico and other states where there are disputed results, and continue the battle for votes right up to the Electoral College decision in December and perhaps beyond, with the Supreme Court and sheer public exhaustion finally ending the matter.\nOr they could come together -- either in person or through trusted emissaries -- and agree to a process that would bring this election to closure as fairly and responsibly as possible. The choice is theirs.\nSince the Florida outcome is the deciding factor, they could agree, for example, to allow both sides to hand count those votes that can be challenged under Florida law and could establish a deadline (perhaps Dec. 1) for conclusion of that process and complete counting of the absentee ballots. The secretary of state for Florida could then certify the final results before the Electoral College votes. Both candidates would agree to abide by that final count.\nThis kind of agreement between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush might not satisfy the campaigns or the lawyers or even some of the voters, but it would be the right thing for the nation. Now the candidates are fighting a legal and propaganda war that both are losing. More important, the nation is losing.\nThe presidency is about putting the nation's interest first. Having served the president, I know the hardest decisions that confront this nation's leaders are the ones that pit the long-term interests of the country against short-term political gain. Deploying troops, raising taxes, vetoing key legislation or revealing a mistake of judgment may not be very popular, but it may be right for the country. The legacy of every president rests with how he responds to that choice.\nBoth of these candidates have campaigned on the basis that they would make the tough choices if and when the time came. That time is now."},
{"headline": null, "content": "A week after Tiger Woods expressed his discontent with the PGA Tour, the father of Venus and Serena Williams said yesterday that his daughters were being taken advantage of by the Women's Tennis Association.\nAlthough the specific complaints vary, Richard Williams drew some parallels between his daughters' situation and the issues Woods and his associates have recently raised.\nSimilar to Woods, the Williamses have dominated their sport's major events, generated higher television ratings and brought new faces to a global audience.\nAnd like Woods, the Williamses want to meet with the head officials of their tour and discuss how everyone can share in the wealth. If given a chance, Richard Williams would also like to address the ranking system, which he believes leaves players to claim injuries in order to avoid fines for missing tournaments during the 11-month season.\nThis week, Venus and Serena Williams cited injuries when they withdrew from the season-ending Chase Championships at Madison Square Garden. Without them, the tournament does not have the same high profile, visibility or marketing might. The PGA Tour also suffers when Woods skips a event.\nWhile Woods has backed off from some statements he made in a Golf World article published last week, indicating that he might be seeking a piece of the PGA Tour's new television agreement, Richard Williams said Venus and Serena should indeed receive a portion of the revenue they help generate for their sport.\n''From our standpoint, when you look at the ratings when Venus and Serena play, they are extremely high,'' Richard Williams said when reached by telephone. ''I think the Tour has been able to benefit from that. I think the people who have helped the Tour to get to where it is now, you should want to share some of that with them instead of keeping it all to yourself.''\nThe WTA does not have a television deal in the United States -- individual events sell their rights -- but the Tour does have a multimillion-dollar contract with EuroSport for tournaments overseas. The tour also has sponsorship agreements that help finance prize money.\nThis year, Venus and Serena Williams, who like Woods are clients of International Management Group, have combined to win more than $3 million on the Tour in addition to the millions they make from endorsements. Still, Richard Williams argues, additional Tour profits should trickle down.\n''The players do receive a piece of the pie,'' Bart McGuire, the chief executive of the WTA, said. ''We take revenues from television and sponsorships and recycle virtually all of it into tournaments and require them to earmark it for prize money increases. So, no, there is no direct payment to Venus or Serena, but the money is there to win.''\nWilliams said he attempted to raise the issue of revenue sharing with McGuire at this year's United State Open. He said he had a face-to-face discussion with McGuire outside Arthur Ashe Stadium, but the conversation went nowhere.\n''First, I asked Mr. McGuire why there weren't more black people working on the Tour,'' Williams said, recounting his conversation. ''Then, I was trying to show him how Venus and Serena have increased television ratings and sold more newspapers, and how they've brought more attention to the Tour than there has ever been before, even when it was in its best condition. I was trying to share with him why I feel we should be able to share in the revenue side of it. It seemed like he didn't want to hear that at that time. It's time to get back to work on it.''\nNeither Venus nor Serena Williams could be reached for a response on their father's concerns. While Richard Williams did not threaten to advise his daughters to leave the WTA Tour, he was not opposed to limiting their exposure.\n''I will try to follow through with Mr. McGuire, and if it doesn't work, we'll see what we can do,'' Williams said. ''We could start limiting the play of the girls. When you do that, you could limit their play in some of the major tournaments, like the Grand Slams. Secondly, what we could do is make people aware of how we think the Tour is being conceited right now.''\nHe cited the ranking system as an example of the Tour's squeezing as much out of the players as possible. The ranking is based on the player's best 18 tournaments, but Williams feels the race to No. 1 should be based on a best-of-12 format. At the rate the sisters are playing, neither one may ever be No. 1. This year, No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis played in 20 tournaments, while third-ranked Venus Williams played in only 10 and sixth-ranked Serena 11.\n''The ranking isn't set up for the players' well-being,'' Williams said. ''It's set up in favor of the Tour itself, for maximum exposure. That's why, to this day, you have so many girls out there who are hurt or who are claiming to be hurt.''\nPlayers must provide a reasonable excuse for missing tournaments or risk being fined by the WTA. At least two other top players on the Tour have privately grumbled about the way Tour officials delicately step around the absences of Venus and Serena Williams. Out of the top 50 players on the Tour, the sisters have played in the fewest tournaments.\nMcGuire said he is not worried about whether Venus and Serena Williams have grown beyond the control of the Tour. He said that he respects Richard Williams's right to voice his opinion and will listen to any issues he has, but that he does not foresee a situation that could become detrimental to the Tour.\n''I think everyone wants to be treated special,'' McGuire said. ''But, no, I don't think they believe they are bigger than the Tour.''\nStill, few officials confront them when they pull out of tournaments. Last week, when Venus Williams withdrew from the Chase Championships because of anemia and Serena because of a foot injury, no one was surprised. Even Richard Williams said his daughters were more mentally exhausted than physically injured.\n''I think that's the case with Venus and Serena,'' Williams said. ''They recognize that you can go out there and play yourself to death, and no one cares when it comes to the closed community of the C.E.O.'s in tennis.''"},

Despite continued losses from its Web operations, the company said yesterday that it expected to meet or exceed estimates for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2001.\nSales for the quarter, which ended Oct. 28, fell to $2.2 billion from $2.5 billion in the period a year earlier.\nThe company said in a conference call that though the quarter's results fell far short of last year, when the toy industry had several hot products, it was nonetheless pleased with its showing. Analysts said a broadened merchandise mix and a store refurbishment program promised to improve performance.\nEarlier this year, Toys ''R'' Us gave up on its go-it-alone Web strategy and agreed to create a co-branded Web site with Amazon.com; setting up the new site led to a nonrecurring charge of $118 million. Excluding these charges, the company said, it posted net income of $15 million, or 7 cents a share, for the third quarter.\nThe Internet unit, Toysrus.com, reported sales of $23 million for the quarter, compared with $5 million for the period a year earlier.\nShares of Toys ''R'' Us, which reported earnings before the market opened, surged almost 12 percent, or $1.81, to close at $18.25 yesterday."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The unveiling of Kim Clijsters continued last night as the 17-year-old from Belgium shook off jet lag, stepped forth as a last-second entrant in a tournament for the elite, then played as if she belonged among the stars at Madison Square Garden.\nUncoiling power from her sturdy frame, and daring to mix in a few drop shots to change the mood of the match, she flicked away another big name on her way up the ranking by defeating fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 7-5, 6-4, in the first round of the Chase Championships.\nTwo years ago, Clijsters finished the season ranked No. 409. This year, she entered the Chase Championships having won 9 of her last 10 matches, lifting her ranking to No. 19. Last Thursday, after several players withdrew with injuries, Clijsters received an invitation to the 16-player draw.\n''My preparation was not great,'' Clijsters said. ''I didn't practice for three or four days. I wasn't expecting to play here. But this is just like a present for me to play here.''\nJust before Clijsters displayed her talents, fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez averted an upset, slipping past Yelena Likhovtseva, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, in the first match of the night. Martinez did what Sanchez-Vicario could not: fend off the next wave of talent.\n''I think she has a lot of potential,'' Sanchez-Vicario said of Clijsters. ''For her age, she is one of the up-and-coming players that will do very well. She's already doing very well, and she will do even better.\n''I'm 12 years older than her. She reminds me a little bit of myself at 17. She hits the ball well, runs after all the balls, and she's very hungry. It's normal that the young ones are coming.''\nClijsters is not just coming along, but barging ahead of her peers. During a two-tournament run this past month, she beat Martinez and 10th-ranked Anna Kournikova, losing only to Martina Hingis. Against Sanchez-Vicario last night, she oozed confidence.\n''I still had a little jet lag; I woke up at 4 a.m. this morning, so that's not really good preparation for your match, especially when you're playing at 8 p.m.,'' Clijsters said. ''At the moment, I feel like I'm getting stronger, like in the past two months. I'm playing with a lot more confidence. Mentally, I'm getting stronger. I'm in the top 20 now, so I'm just trying to take this and see where it ends.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "At a party recently a woman was overheard to say: ''My husband and I love watching 'The Practice.' It always gives us something to talk about we hadn't thought much about before, I don't know, like the Fourth Amendment.''\n''Real Justice,'' a two-part report on the ''Frontline'' series on PBS about the workings of the Suffolk County criminal courts in Boston, mercifully offers a different kind of civics lesson. Earnest drama gives way to scruffy realism, as video cameras observe defense lawyers and prosecutors resolving cases not with high-minded lectures about the Constitution but through bartering and social work and tedious presentations of mundane evidence. Much time goes to scheduling the annual load of 50,000 cases.\nLitigation has always been an American obsession and never more since the admission of cameras into courtrooms paved the way for Court TV, a channel devoted to exploitation in the name of illumination. Television has made the pursuit of justice -- especially when vile crimes are involved -- a spectator sport, and a profitable one.\nWhile ambitious young people may be veering toward business and media in real life, on prime-time television dramas medicine and law remain the professions with the most consistent ratings track record. No wonder a presidential election has ended up in court.\nThe producers of ''Real Justice'' have shrewdly capitalized on this obsession while aiming to convey a more realistic portrait of a legal system that seems as stressed and haphazard as Florida's balloting. Defense lawyers meet clients on the way to a court appearance, with barely a chance to find out their names, much less whether they're telling the truth or not.\nProsecutors spend little time making impassioned and erudite speeches the way their fictional counterparts often do. They're too busy negotiating bargains that often feel like deals with the devil. Jurors acquit obviously guilty defendants for good reasons (because the evidence was lacking) and bad (because they share the prejudices of a man accused of a homophobic attack).\nSuch revelations once would have been startling and subversive. Now they might seem like yet another variation on the culture's fascination with process and television's current infatuation with nonfiction (a k a ''reality programming''). So many options! You can watch open-heart surgery on TLC, a rape case on Court TV, or how to build a flying machine out of broken appliances on ''Junkyard Wars.'' This onslaught of information and instruction has made it difficult for serious documentarians to distinguish themselves.\nBut Ben Loeterman and Ben Gale, the producers of ''Real Justice,'' have brought a discerning perspective to the daily grind of cases, where the petty and the profound can become indistinguishable in the dull glare of institutional fluorescent lights. They particularize the numbing crush by focusing on a handful of lawyers, poorly paid system operatives who handle the bulk of criminal cases, in which victims and defendants tend to be poor and notably unglamorous.\n''Not fair, your honor, he's not the brightest guy in the world,'' says a defense lawyer, when a prosecutor asks a defendant to clarify a simple matter.\nTonight's episode, which deals with nonviolent cases, is far more surprising and fascinating than the second program, which covers the more titillating but more familiar territory of violent crime (in a serious, nontitillating way). As the judges and lawyers process prosaic infractions, they often dispense justice in the form of pragmatic calculations.\nWill jail or probation be more likely to keep a harmless homeless man from repeating his crime, trespassing in a college library? Will a car-theft victim prefer to be paid damages or to prosecute the case against the man who stole his car?\nThe lawyers themselves recognize the inherent absurdity in their impossible case loads and sometimes ridiculous cases, which are often more dreary than pulpy: in one, a woman accuses a former friend of spitting at her and throwing a liquor bottle at her car. Some of the lawyers seem to amuse themselves with theatrical exaggeration, or maybe they are simply mugging for the camera, like the lawyer who proclaims, on winning a case: ''Right now I feel like a king. The system works, and I got a role in it and the people listened.''\nOthers haven't bothered to comb their hair. But almost all of the lawyers project genuine compassion along with equally genuine cynicism and weariness. No one mentions the Constitution.\nFRONTLINE: Real Justice\nPBS, tonight and next Tuesday night\n(Channel 13, New York, at 10)\nProduced by Ben Loeterman and Ben Gale; written by Ben Loeterman; directed by Ben Gale and Leeanne Vinson; Peter Rhodes, co-producer and editor; Will Lyman, narrator.

{"headline": null, "content": "Hewlett-Packard, the nation's third-largest computer company, shocked Wall Street's already jittery technology investors yesterday morning with the news that its earnings had fallen well short of projections despite stronger-than-expected sales.\nHewlett-Packard also announced that its negotiations to acquire the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers had been called off, a not entirely unexpected development that many on Wall Street treated as good news. Most analysts had been arguing that the Pricewaterhouse asking price was too steep -- a deal worth as much as $18 billion had been discussed in September -- and many feared that Hewlett-Packard would find that absorbing 31,000 consultants was too distracting.\nThe announcements were made before trading began yesterday. Investors, who had been expecting earnings to be released at the end of the day, reacted by sending Hewlett-Packard's stock plunging nearly 17 percent in heavy early trading. As the surprise wore off, sentiment improved and the shares ended the day at $34.81, down $4.44.\nHewlett-Packard said that it earned $922 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, in the quarter that ended Oct. 31 , a 21 percent increase from the $760 million, or 36 cents, reported a year ago. Revenue jumped 17 percent, to $13.3 billion from $11.4 billion a year ago.\nBut the headline for Wall Street was that excluding gains on investments and other one-time financial events, Hewlett-Packard's earnings amounted to 41 cents a share, a full 10 cents a share less than Wall Street's expectations, based on analysts' projections tracked by First Call/ Thomson Financial.\nInvestors had been looking for news that would reverse the slide that began in July when Hewlett-Packard's stock topped $68, but this only added to their concerns. Instead, they heard Carly Fiorina, the Hewlett-Packard chairwoman and chief executive, apologizing not just for the earnings shortfall but for the company's inability to see it coming.\nUnlike last week, when Dell sent technology shares plunging by meeting expectations but forecasting slower-than-projected growth for next year, Hewlett-Packard's news was harder for investors to parse.\n''There is no one overriding cause,'' Ms. Fiorina said during a conference call with analysts. She went on to give a litany of reasons for the earnings shortfall, some of which might be classified as good news in disguise.\nThe clear-cut rotten apples in the mix included an increase in bad debts in the finance arm and losses in the company's venture capital portfolio stemming from the woes of dot-com start-ups in which Hewlett-Packard had a stake. Ms. Fiorina said that the latter problem was being addressed by a management shake-up, a more formal process to review investments and lowered ceilings on how much the company will invest in individual start-ups.\nHewlett-Packard's Verifone subsidiary, which sells electronic payment services, performed worse than expected, costing $48 million in losses and restructuring costs in the quarter. Hewlett-Packard has been unsuccessfully looking for a way to sell the unit.\nAnd, like many other multinational technology giants, Hewlett-Packard also suffered from the unexpected trends in exchange rates during the quarter. Profits from sales in Europe were reduced and the costs of laser printer components in Japan were higher than projected.\nBut a substantial part of the shortfall came from developments that might be seen more as accounting surprises than bad news. Selling expenses were unexpectedly high because the sales force responded more enthusiastically than anticipated to incentive packages. The fired-up sales force pushed revenue for October higher than Hewlett-Packard had expected and created a strong order backlog for the current quarter, which is the first of fiscal 2001 for the company.\nMs. Fiorina said that the company was re-examining the incentives but that the problem was largely self-curing since most were automatically reset when the new quarter started.\nAnother unexpected growth in costs resulted from faster-than-expected hiring of new sales employees, consultants and researchers. Ms. Fiorina said that the hiring would pay off in the future. However, the company is now requiring senior executives to oversee it more closely to prevent future spending surprises, Ms. Fiorina said.\nTaken together, the various problems highlighted weaknesses at the company in tracking its businesses rather than serious earnings concerns, Ms. Fiorina said. The monitoring shortcomings should be addressed by new information systems the company brought online Nov. 1 and unexpected selling expenses should be better controlled by new tools managers have been given to track pricing and profits in their groups, she said.\n''The reality is that our business is healthy with good momentum,'' she told analysts.\nShe said that revenues would grow 15 percent to 17 percent in the coming year and that the mix of products sold would shift toward higher-margin products as the year progressed.\nMs. Fiorina and analysts agreed that the company was unlikely to win back investors until it had shown that it could meet both revenue and earnings growth projections. ''People are worried they had to get too aggressive on price to drive the revenue growth,'' said Antonio Sacconaghi, who follows the company for Sanford C. Bernstein.\nThe end of the Pricewaterhouse talks removed at least one weight on the stock though. ''It would have been a huge distraction,'' said Daniel Kuntsler, who follows Hewlett-Packard for J. P. Morgan.\nMs. Fiorina denied that integrating so many consultants would have been a problem. She called the consulting company a ''high-quality operation'' and said that the strategic logic for such a deal was ''compelling.'' But she acknowledged that the two sides had been unable to agree on how to make sure the consultants stayed with Hewlett-Packard. Perhaps the biggest roadblock though was what James J. Schiro, chief executive of Pricewaterhouse, diplomatically called ''market conditions.''\nIn plain English, the sharp decline in Hewlett-Packard's stock since the talks began made it impossible for the two sides to agree on a cash-and-stock package large enough to satisfy the consultants without killing the stock."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Hewlett-Packard has sent PricewaterhouseCoopers back to the drawing board.\nThe decision by Hewlett to withdraw its bid for the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business leaves the accounting firm still looking for an exit strategy at a time of retrenchment in the consulting industry, as firms struggle with the rising costs of new technology and retaining employees. The accounting firms that provide consulting services face the additional burden of regulatory concerns about their providing advice to their audit clients.\nThese factors have driven several recent transactions, in addition to the failed effort by PricewaterhouseCoopers to sell its consulting arm. Some of the firms want to gain access to capital markets, either to be able to offer stock to employees or to raise funds to invest in technology. Others, to avoid having to jump into volatile equity markets, want to get out of technology consulting entirely.\nSo KPMG Consulting, a subsidiary of KPMG L.L.P., is planning an initial public offering, and Andersen Consulting has said it is considering one. On the other hand, Ernst & Young announced the sale of its consulting business to Cap Gemini in March, and Grant Thornton said earlier this month that it would sell its Internet consulting unit to Hitachi.\nConsulting firms have been confronted with greater competition for talented employees, as the economy generated jobs with the hope of instant riches in the form of stock options. With a public offering, companies like Andersen Consulting and KPMG Consulting can offer stock options to employees.\n''Being able to reward people is big, though not as big since the dot-com collapse,'' said Jack Sweeney, an editor at Kennedy Information, which follows the industry. The stock options are crucial in attracting and retaining employees, he said, adding, ''These consulting organizations, that's what they are: talent.''\nAccess to capital markets also allows companies a way of financing the investments in technology that some consultants need to provide not just advice, but also the hardware and software to apply that advice. ''Otherwise, all we have to operate with is cash,'' said Elizabeth Brooks, a KPMG Consulting spokeswoman.\nThe need to invest in technology also explains why producers like Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard have sought to buy into consulting: they have technological expertise and access to capital markets already, and hoped to expand into providing services, which can be more lucrative than the highly competitive manufacture of technology products. Hewlett-Packard, however, found PricewaterhouseCoopers' price too high under present market conditions.\nSome technology companies, like I.B.M., are very well established in consulting already. Companies like United Parcel Service are inching their way into the market by offering services that look very similar to consulting and that complement their products. ''There's no doubt we do more and more consulting,'' though for now it is usually limited to supply and distribution, said Joe Pyne, senior vice president for marketing and corporate development. ''More and more of our present customers are asking for that.''\nAccounting firms with consulting units face the prospect of regulatory restrictions in the wake of concerns voiced by Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, over accountants' both advising and auditing the same client. In recent weeks, discussions between the S.E.C. and accounting firms over a proposal to limit the consulting services that an auditor may provide have proceeded in fits and starts.\n''There's a big issue there,'' Mr. Sweeney said. For example, an accounting firm may audit a client whose rival is a strategic partner of the firm's consulting unit -- a significant potential conflict of interest. ''The nature of deal making,'' he said, ''is going to brush up against more of these S.E.C. regulations than ever before.''\nConsulting firms that are independent of auditors have aggressively pursued such alliances, though, as a way to reach capital markets. Andersen Consulting, separated by an arbitration ruling from Arthur Andersen, has formed a joint venture, Avanade, with Microsoft, built around Microsoft's Windows 2000 software. Andersen has said Avanade may some day sell shares.\nBooz-Allen & Hamilton will announce today that it is creating an independent Internet consulting company that may go public.\nBut Pricewaterhouse will have to come up with an alternative response to these trends, and the company's value can be expected to go down if uncertainty about the future of its consulting unit drives away employees.\nBy delaying a transaction for the duration of negotiations and then backing out, Hewlett-Packard has made the consulting unit less appealing and the bidding less competitive, said Daniel Kunstler of J. P. Morgan Securities, adding, ''They were perceived to be a generous bidder.''\n''We've been pursuing various options,'' said James J. Schiro, Pricewaterhouse's chief executive, adding that the company considered a public offering and sale to a strategic investor, among other things, before dealing with Hewlett-Packard. ''Now that they're out,'' he said, ''we can pursue these other options.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "The Supreme Court agreed today to resolve an important and longstanding dispute over how to assess police officers' liability in suits for damages over the use of excessive force.\nThe case, growing out of an incident at a San Francisco military base during an appearance there six years ago by Vice President Al Gore, is an appeal by the federal government on an issue that comes up frequently in excessive force cases.\nUnder the Supreme Court's precedents on police behavior, excessive force is force that was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances. But what about police officers who mistakenly believed at the time that the force they used was necessary, even if, by the objective standard later applied by a judge or jury, it was not?\nUnder a defense known as qualified immunity, police officers or other public officials who are sued for violating someone's constitutional rights cannot be held liable if either the law at the time of the incident was unclear, or if they reasonably believed at the time that their conduct was lawful.\nThe concept of qualified immunity becomes analytically complex when, as in the case today, the question is the right under the Fourth Amendment to be free of unreasonable seizure.\nWith ''reasonableness'' being the test both for qualified immunity and for the constitutional right itself, the lower federal courts have not been able to agree on whether a finding that force was excessive -- in other words, unreasonable -- necessarily precludes a finding of qualified immunity.\nIn this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, took the view that since the same legal standard governed both liability and immunity, a finding of excessive force meant that, by definition, a police officer could not claim qualified immunity.\n''An officer cannot have an objectively reasonable belief that the force used was necessary (entitling the officer to qualified immunity),'' the Ninth Circuit said, ''when no reasonable officer could have believed that the force used was necessary (establishing a Fourth Amendment violation).''\nThe appeals court refused to throw out a 1994 lawsuit by an animal rights activist against a military police officer who had led him away from a speech by Vice President Gore at the Presidio, then an Army base, thrown him into a van, and detained him for a short time at a military police station before releasing him and allowing him to go home.\nThe plaintiff, Elliot Katz, a veterinarian, was president of an organization called In Defense of Animals that was protesting animal experimentation at the hospital on the base. Dr. Katz had begun to unfurl a four-foot-long banner he had brought to the event when the military police officer, Donald Saucier, intercepted and removed him.\nDr. Katz, 60 at the time, was not injured but said in his lawsuit that he was handled roughly and might well have been injured.\nIn its Supreme Court appeal, Saucier v. Katz, No. 99-1977, the government is arguing that the Ninth Circuit's approach ''effectively creates a no-force rule for many arrests, and invites inappropriate second-guessing of an officer's on-the-spot judgment.'' The government said the point of qualified immunity was to give ''ample room for mistaken judgments'' and that therefore the test for immunity and the test for Fourth Amendment liability should not be one and the same.\nA police officer's action could be both objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and still such a close call that reasonable officers on the scene could disagree, the government said, adding that the appeals court ''fundamentally erred by employing hindsight to second-guess the perceptions and actions of the officers on the scene.''\nIn responding to the government's appeal, Dr. Katz's lawyers agreed that the Supreme Court should take the case in order to ''provide a clear, simple, uniform methodology for the trial courts to handle the issue of qualified immunity in excessive force cases.''\nIn another case today, the court, without comment, turned down an appeal by a Mexican man convicted of bringing nearly 100 pounds of marijuana across the border. The Customs Service agents who arrested Jose Lombera-Camorlinga did not inform him of his right, under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to have a Mexican consular official notified of his arrest.\nWhen he was questioned, Mr. Lombera-Camorlinga made incriminating statements that he then moved to suppress after he was indicted. He argued that as a penalty for violating his right to consular notification, the prosecution should not be able to use the statements. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument.\nIn his appeal to the Supreme Court, Lombera-Camorlinga v. United States, No. 99-9927, the question was whether the exclusionary rule, which ordinarily bars the use at trial of illegally obtained statements, was the right remedy for a violation of the Vienna Convention.\nThere was no dispute in the case that the convention was violated. But the government argued that violations should be dealt with through diplomacy. Because the treaty ''does not implicate constitutional norms fundamental to the criminal justice system,'' the exclusionary rule should not apply, the government's brief said."},
{"headline": null, "content": "A New York State law frequently cited in efforts to disqualify third-party or other lesser-established candidates from state or local election ballots has been ruled unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals.\nThe ruling, reversing a judgment by the Federal District Court, was hailed yesterday by voting rights advocates and election lawyers who said that it would now be much easier for upstart candidates in everything from City Council races to bids for the governor's office to secure a spot on election ballots. The same provision was cited by supporters of Senator John McCain of Arizona when he had trouble last year earning a place on the presidential primary ballot across New York State.\n''It certainly is going to ease the burden,'' said Henry T. Berger, a Manhattan election lawyer. ''It removes a significant impediment in terms of getting nontraditional candidates on the ballot.''\nThe ruling came as a result of a challenge filed last year by a Staten Island woman, Anita Lerman, who had collected signatures in 1999 on behalf of John Sollazo, an Independence Party candidate for a City Council seat from Staten Island. Mr. Sollazo was denied a spot on a primary ballot because Ms. Lerman, while also a Staten Island resident and Independence Party member, did not live in the same council district as Mr. Sollazo, so the signatures she collected were disqualified.\nThe three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded in a decision issued Thursday in Manhattan that because the Independence Party has so few members in Staten Island -- and any person collecting signatures must be a party member -- the residency requirement ''dramatically reduced the number of potential petition circulators available to advance Sollazo's political message.''\nThe city and the state had argued that the residency requirement helps prevent fraud. But the Court of Appeals responded that the time had long since passed when signature collectors knew each of their neighbors personally. In addition, the state and city boards of elections can already check voters' signatures against computerized copies on file.\nGiven these findings, the judges concluded that the rule ''significantly burdens interactive political speech and political association without advancing any state interest and, therefore, violates the First Amendment.''\nPatricia L. Murray, deputy counsel for the State Board of Elections, and Tahirih M. Sadrieh, the lawyer from the New York City corporation counsel's office who handled the case, would not comment on the ruling, saying that they had not had a chance to read it. They also would not say whether they intended to appeal the ruling.\nThe requirements regarding signature collectors may sound obscure, but questions regarding the residency of petition collectors frequently surface during ballot challenges, said Mr. Berger and Nancy J. Northup, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, a voting rights group in Manhattan that represented Ms. Lerman.\nCandidates who have the tacit or official backing of mainstream parties typically have little trouble getting signatures, as they have party activists across the state -- or if it is a local contest, in their districts -- that they can turn to for help. But such an undertaking can be difficult for a candidate from groups like the Independence Party, or as in Senator McCain's case, in which Republican Party leaders had already lined up behind Gov. George W. Bush.\nNow a candidate, assuming the decision is not overturned on appeal, can send a team of campaign workers into any district to collect signatures, as long as the workers are registered members of the party in New York State. Such a standard has already applied to presidential primaries in the state, as of February, after the residency requirement for petition collectors was challenged by Mr. McCain and others. ''It expands numerically those who are available to petition,'' Ms. Northup said. ''I think it will make a tremendous difference.''\nBut even with the ruling, New York State is likely to remain a difficult place to earn a spot on the ballot for lesser-established candidates, Ms. Northup and Mr. Berger said. Several remaining provisions complicate the process, they said, like rules that no person can sign the petition of more than one candidate for a particular office or that all signatures must be collected within a 37-day period.\n''The mess is not eliminated,'' Mr. Berger said. ''Getting on the ballot, particularly for nontraditional candidates, still presents huge burdens. Now the candidate would have more people to help overcome that.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "In just a few months, the auction of Europe's high-speed wireless licenses, once ballyhooed as heralding a new generation of Internet-linked mobile phones and other devices, has turned from cash cow to fiasco.\nToday, Switzerland offered the newest wrinkle with an auction that never was. Just minutes before bidding was set to start in Zurich for four licenses, a string of deals that would effectively merge two of the bidders into one reduced the number of potential buyers from five to four. That along with the earlier withdrawal by 5 of the original 10 contenders, who complained that the licenses would probably be too costly, prompted the Swiss authorities to postpone indefinitely a sale they had hoped would generate more than $3.4 billion.\nThe collapse of the auction in Switzerland -- the first to occur before bidding even started -- followed a debacle in Italy last month when one of six bidders, Blu S.p.A., a consortium controlled by Autostrade S.p.A. of Italy and British Telecommunications, dropped out after only two rounds. The withdrawal forced the premature end of competition for five licenses and left the Italian government smarting with income of about $10.5 billion, less than half the expected revenue.\nAustria and the Netherlands also earned far less than anticipated in auctions this year.\nIf Switzerland is now forced to sell the licenses for the minimum bid price it will earn no more than $113 million -- a paltry sum in comparison with the trail-blazing auctions earlier this year for these so-called third-generation licenses that earned $35.5 billion for the British Treasury and $46 billion for the German authorities.\nSo what happened?\nPart of the answer lies in the price European telecommunications companies have already paid for third- generation licenses, contributing to soaring debt and falling stock. This year alone, telecommunications companies have spent roughly $100 billion, mainly in the British and German auctions, just to buy licenses. That does not include a similar amount needed to build networks intended to open new vistas of high-speed mobile Internet access from wireless devices across most of Europe.\nThe costs have already taken a toll on the once-freewheeling style of telecommunications companies, forcing them to shelve plans for mergers and acquisitions in favor of raising cash to pay off debt. British Telecommunications, for instance, which was one of the companies in the deals that scuttled Switzerland's auction today, last week announced plans for a revamping, including a split into two, to trim some $14.5 billion off a debt mountain forecast to reach some $43.5 billion by next March.\nAnd in both the Italian and Swiss auctions, the British company sought to extricate itself from alliances that could have become embroiled in extended and expensive bidding.\n''That's a very simple example of the debt levels reflecting third-generation auctions and strategic developments since then definitely having a major impact,'' said Mark Lambert, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.\nTelecommunications giants have been maneuvering for position in advance of the auctions. Last week, Vodafone Group, the world leader in wireless phones, announced it would pay $2.5 billion for a 25 percent stake in the wireless unit of Swisscom A.G., Switzerland's state-controlled mobile phone company. Swisscom was one of the remaining bidders at the auction today. So was a consortium led by Telefonica S.A. of Spain as well as Orange Communications S. A. of Switzerland, in which France Telecom agreed last week to double its stake to 85 percent.\n''By teaming up with local players before the auction, they really maximize the chance of getting a license,'' said Philip Carse, an analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.\nOther big telecommunications players, including Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Deutsche Telekom A.G., simply pulled out of the Swiss auction in advance. ''Everybody is now realizing that this is a game of deep pockets, so the companies that bought in Britain and Germany are looking to not paying a lot in other markets,'' Mr. Carse said.\nThe fourth player in today's Swiss auction turned out to be a merger of two Swiss bidders, Sunrise Communications A. G. and diAx A.G., which was 40 percent owned by SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio. In a complex string of deals, Denmark's leading phone company, Tele Danmark, which already had a stake in Sunrise and which is 42 percent owned by SBC Communications, agreed to pay $2 billion to end up with 89 percent of Sunrise and 70 percent of diAx, including SBC's stake. It then said it would merge the two Swiss concerns. Under the deal, British Telecommunications earned $658 million from the sale of its 34 percent stake in Sunrise.\nThe fast footwork left Swiss regulators to ponder a dizzying new line-up. ''Virtually all candidates have undergone major changes in structure and ownership in the last few days,'' said a statement from Bakom, the Swiss federal telecommunications office. ''This may affect the competition framework today and in the future on the Swiss market.''\nThe postponement also left some of the remaining bidders fuming. Swisscom said it would consider legal action if a new auction were called. Therese Wenger, a spokeswoman for Orange Communications, said, ''We note the decision with astonishment.''\nToday's twists turned the spotlight onto the last major sale of third-generation wireless licenses, set for early next year in France.\nFrance, unlike other countries, has opted for what is called a ''beauty contest'' sale, allocating licenses to bidders prepared to pay a set price.\n''That may turn out to be the smartest move,'' Mr. Lambert of Merrill Lynch said."},

{"headline": null, "content": "IT was about 8 o'clock on Saturday night, Nov. 14, 1970 -- 30 years ago today -- when Reggie Oliver, a quarterback on the Marshall University freshman team, heard the news of the airplane crash as it crackled over his car radio.\nHe was driving in a rain and fog -- the radio reception seemed to be affected -- to a convenience store in Huntington, W.Va., to pick up a six-pack of beer. Oliver was fulfilling a request from the day before from Larry Sanders, a junior running back on the team.\nThey had been friends and teammates in high school in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Sanders would be flying back with the Marshall team from their game against East Carolina in Greenville, N.C. In those days, freshmen were not eligible for the varsity, so the 18-year-old Oliver stayed home on such trips.\n''Larry asked me to have the beers when he came back to the dorm,'' Oliver said recently by phone from his home in Columbus, Ohio. ''He handed me three or four dollars for the beers and said, 'Make sure they're cold when I get back.' Those were the last words he said to me. I had the itinerary, and I was timing my getting the beer to when the team arrived back on campus. The report didn't say it was the plane carrying the team. But I knew it was their plane. It had to be. I was in total disbelief.\n''I drove back to campus and I picked up five other guys. One, Felix Jordan, was a varsity football player who'd been injured and didn't make the trip. We raced to the airport to see what we could do to help.''\nThere was nothing for them to do. The Southern Airways DC-9, flying for the mountaintop Tri-State Airport, hit the tops of pine trees instead, cartwheeled into a mountainside and blew up. Thirty-eight members of the Thundering Herd football team along with coaches and other athletic department personnel, local boosters of the team and some of their wives, were killed. Seventy-five in all. There were no survivors. It remains the worst American sports team disaster in history.\nOliver and his friends stood on a hill some distance away from the wreckage, the sight still ''frozen in time'' in his mind.\n''Fires were blazing in the fog and rain,'' he said, ''and fire trucks were all over the place. That's when it hit me that it was real, that it wasn't a nightmare. And Larry was gone. I had three other friends from high school on that team -- Joe Hood and Freddy Wilson and Robert Van Horn. They were gone, too.''\nOliver -- now 48, the head football coach at Eastmoor Academy in Columbus -- returned to campus once again last weekend, for the last home game of the season. Marshall played host to Miami of Ohio. There were many anniversary commemorations of the tragedy. Seventy-five Marshall flags were hung from light poles along the route from the Marshall University stadium to the cemetery. A moment of silence was observed at halftime. And, adjacent to the stadium, a 12-foot-high bronze memorial was unveiled, commemorating the memory of the crash and the rise of the Marshall football program.\nToday, the annual service will be held again at the Memorial Fountain in the campus plaza.\nThe next season after the disaster, in their first home game against Xavier, with primarily freshmen (now allowed to be eligible under the circumstances) and sophomores, ex-basketball and soccer players, Marshall was a 20-point underdog. But they won on a last-second pass from Oliver, then a sophomore quarterback, to the freshman wide receiver Terry Gardner.\n''It was unbelievable,'' Oliver said. ''We were so emotionally high for the game. It was probably the greatest upset in college football history.''\nJack Lengyl, the new Marshall coach, had said that it ''seemed like more than just a football game.'' Marshall lost its next game, to Miami of Ohio, 66-6, and won just once more that season. The rebirth of the Marshall football program gradually got better and better. It had losing records in the 1970's, broke about even in the '80s. But in the '90s, its 114 victories were the most of any National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I team, and had included some outstanding players, like Randy Moss, now an All-Pro with the Minnesota Vikings. Marshall is 6-5, after finishing last season with a 13-0 record.\n''It's been 30 years, but not a day goes by when I don't think of the plane crash,'' Oliver said. ''And I remind myself: 'Live life to the fullest. Nothing is promised.' ''\nOh yes, Marshall beat Miami of Ohio Saturday night, 51-31. Nice, but as Marshall fans surely understand, it was just a football game."},

Summer after summer we drove from Iowa to the Black Hills, to Wyoming, to Colorado, never eastward. We also lived 100 miles, in opposite directions, from both sets of my grandparents, whom we visited again and again. There was always something to look at along the country highways we took, and there was always a way to look at it. The car hummed along the high asphalt crown between the ditches. We drove through thickets of grove shade and farm scent. Barnyards gaped suddenly as we passed and then they closed again as quickly.\nThe way to look at it all was to accept its passing. To see something interesting you had to be looking right at it as it flew by. If you didn't see it, you wouldn't see it, no matter how quickly you turned your head or how hard you looked back down the road. There was no entanglement with the scenery. Sometimes a farmer would wave from the field or a woman from beside a rural mailbox. Sometimes a driver coming the other way would raise a couple of fingers. That was it. In the far distance the horizon slowly revolved while houses and outbuildings, cattle and soybeans seemed to fling themselves past us along the roadside, slowing only as we came to the outskirts of a town. A lot of us grew up just that way.\nBut in this present life, I sometimes ride an old quarter horse named Remedy up the gravel road that runs past our place. The pace of travel is different, of course, and the scenery is no longer self-contained. A drama taking place in a driveway or a side yard doesn't elapse in a split second, as it does when you drive by in a car. It has a chance to play out, and our passing changes the way it plays. As we ride along the road, Remedy and I are always trading measures of alertness. He notices everything long before I do, but he is surprised by things I happen to know are not surprising. We are implicated in the world. Everyone waves, and we wave too. People come out onto their porches and pull curtains aside to look, and we look back. There is more than enough time for acknowledgment.\nEast of our place, there runs a two-lane blacktop road just like the ones that crisscross Iowa. Most of the time it is pretty quiet, but for a few hours on weekends it carries a lot of traffic. Squads of bikers come rumbling down the hill while R.V.'s struggle up the hill. On Saturdays, a parade of pickup trucks towing race cars makes its way to the track 10 miles north of us. In winter and on rainy days, truckers rattle their jake-brakes all the way down the hill.\nWhenever I work in the vegetable garden or attend to the bees or feed the horses, I step into an amphitheater that rises from the road. I imagine myself as a child driving past in the back seat of the family car, looking across a pasture at a man walking down the yard in a bee suit and a veil.

Archer and Credit Suisse First Boston, which recently acquired Donaldson, declined to comment.\nThe bid, which analysts and experts had been expecting after several investors criticized the earlier bid as inadequate, is just the latest play by Smithfield Foods, which over the last few years has moved aggressively to acquire hog production and processing operations across the country.\nSmithfield, which is based in Smithfield, Va., is now seeking to acquire in IBP the nation's largest supplier of fresh beef and pork, a meatpacker three times its size with more than $14 billion in annual revenue.\nThe deal, which was reported today in The Wall Street Journal, would create a stronger rival to giant food processors like Cargill Inc. and ConAgra.\nThe new company, with nearly $20 billion in revenue, would become the world's largest hog producer and meatpacker, controlling more than a third of all pork and beef sold in the United States.\n''There's tremendous consolidation taking place at the retail and food service level,'' said Joseph W. Luter III, the chief executive at Smithfield Foods. ''We need to consolidate to remain competitive. This is a defensive play on our part.''\nThe deal, however, could face regulatory hurdles because of growing concerns that a few big food producers already wield too much control over the nation's food supply.\nIn the last year, Smithfield has been criticized for creating a vertically integrated company that owns both hog farms and slaughterhouses, a system that some small farmers fear could lead to manipulation in the market for hogs.\nSeveral farm groups and small hog farmers protested Smithfield's moves last year, when it acquired Murphy Family Farms, the giant hog producer in Iowa.\nMany farmers still fear that a bigger Smithfield will mean small farmers are squeezed out of the market.\n''I don't think it's a good idea when you start vertically integrating the hog operations,'' said Tim Jorgensen, a hog farmer in Garrison, Iowa. ''If a packer wants to buy 100,000 hogs and I've got 100 and some guy has 50,000, who do you think is going to get the better price?''\nSmithfield, however, insists that its effort to become larger is intended to create a more efficient and streamlined operation, one that would keep pork prices low and open new markets at home and abroad for small farmers by offering new 'value-added' products like Smithfield's own branded and precooked meats.\nSmithfield executives, however, acknowledge that regulators could impede the company's effort to acquire IBP, which is the No. 2 player in the pork industry, because the combined company would have about 38 percent of the pork-processing market.\nSmithfield, which already owns about 6.6 percent of IBP, said it might divest itself of some of the combined company's 12 pork processing plants, to appease regulators, giving the company a market share in the mid-30's in both beef and pork.\n''I think we've addressed the antitrust concerns,'' Mr. Luter said, noting that the company has sought the advice of antitrust experts. ''We might have to divest one or two plants at the most.''\nAnalysts say that if Smithfield is successful in acquiring IBP, which is based in Dakota Dunes, S.D., the deal would merge two companies that are moving aggressively to revolutionize the meat business.\nBoth IBP and Smithfield have been investing in higher-value products, like precooked meats for consumers on the go. And both companies are offering what grocers call ''case-ready'' meats, which are packaged by the processor and not the supermarket butcher.\nWal-Mart has already moved to do away with supermarket butchers and is offering ''case-ready'' beef from IBP, a development that food analysts say will reduce supermarket staffs, open up more space for retailers and provide a safer and more consistent cut of meat.\nChristine McCracken, an analyst at Midwest Research, said that the Smithfield-IBP deal would accelerate the changes under way at major grocers, which are moving toward case-ready offerings.\n''The hamburger on the shelf is ground up steak that's been sitting there for four days,'' she said. ''With case-ready products, you won't have the contamination issues you have when a guy in the back cuts it up.''\nSmithfield says a merger with IBP will also create greater efficiencies, cutting transportation and supply costs. The company said it expected to save up to $200 million a year once the merger is complete.\nSmithfield's offer is set against a collar on the company's stock price, which means that a sharp drop could lower the value of its bid for IBP. Smithfield would also assume about $1.4 billion in IBP debt."},

The Postal Service Board of Governors, which normally approves such measures, must vote on the proposal.\nCommission officials said the increase, which is expected to bring an additional $2.5 billion in revenue, was needed to offset rising costs. It falls short, however, of the $2.8 billion requested by the Postal Service in January.\nOther plans include a 30-cent increase in the one-pound Priority Mail service, to $3.50 from $3.20; a 50-cent increase for 8-ounce Express Mail service, to $12.25 from $11.75; and a 50-cent increase in certified mail, to $1.90 from $1.40. Postcard postage will remain 20 cents.\nMagazine publishers succeeded in lobbying for a somewhat lower rate increase than first proposed for periodicals, a category that includes most consumer magazines. The Magazine Publishers of America fought a proposed increase of 15 percent. According to the publishers, that would have cost the industry $300 million over the next two years. The commission called for an increase of 9.9 percent.\nNina B. Link, president of the publishers' group, said today that she was pleased that the commission had met the group's goal but added that the group would continue to fight steep increases.\nChristopher M. Little, president of the Meredith Publishing Group, said the increase was too high.\n''I appreciate that this has come down all the way from 15 percent, but this is still significantly higher than the rate of inflation,'' he said. ''I think the magazine industry has to maintain the same level of intensity and effort going forward to never let this happen again.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "To Web site designers, programmers and other technology workers, the shakeout that has doomed many a New York City Internet company has been sobering. But landlords in Silicon Alley say they think the dot-com blues may be sweet for them.\nThe landlords hope to reclaim the leases of failing dot-coms that moved into their offices in the less prosperous mid-1990's, and then charge new tenants much higher rents, which are the norm in today's tight commercial real estate market.\nAgents and landlords alike say that many traditional companies are lining up to take over Silicon Alley space once occupied by dot-coms that have retrenched or folded. Even though dot-coms make up only a fraction of occupied office space in Manhattan, the shakeout is ''returning much-needed space back to the market,'' said L. Craig Lemle, corporate managing director at the real estate broker Julien J. Studley.\nSilicon Alley is loosely defined as the area between Wall Street and the Flatiron district, so dot-com space is often in popular neighborhoods and is even more valuable because it is already wired with high-speed Internet connections that virtually every small to medium-size business now demands. ''It is built, wired and available,'' said Mr. Lemle, who represented Boo.com North America, the online clothing site that shut down in September.\nJust how much financial advantage building owners will be able to take remains to be seen. Boo.com and at least one other failed Internet start-up, Pseudo Programs Inc., have filed for protection in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Each company is trying to block its landlord's efforts to break its lease.\nBoth companies say they want to resell their leases to other companies willing to pay large sums to be able to take advantage of the low rents in the original lease agreements, which were signed before Lower Manhattan's commercial real estate market began to soar. The companies would sell the leases at a price that is slightly higher than what they paid but still well below the current rental market.\nOfficials of Boo.com and Pseudo have said they will use any money from selling the lease agreements to help pay outstanding debts.\nIn the first half of this year, dot-coms chased after space in every quarter of Manhattan, driving up rents and accounting for a quarter of all the leasing deals in the borough, according to a recent report by Cushman & Wakefield, the realty firm.\nBut dot-coms still take up only a small percentage of the city's commercial space -- far less than financial service companies and law firms. In the last few months, nearly 30 dot-coms have given up about one million square feet of Silicon Alley office space, the report said. Technology companies are signing far fewer leases than in the recent past.\nOn June 1, 1994, Pseudo signed a 10-year lease with Brocros Realty for roughly 11,000 square feet on the sixth floor of a loft building at 600 Broadway, near Houston Street in SoHo. Pseudo is paying about $7 per square foot for space that real estate experts believe is now worth about $40 per square foot. That means a new tenant would save about $1.3 million over the 42 months remaining on the lease.\nIn court papers, Boo.com said it wanted to sell the time left on a lease it signed on April 30, 1999, to another Internet company, Radical Media. The original lease, with Trinity Church, is for 9,000 square feet on the seventh floor of 435 Hudson Street in the old printing district. Boo.com's asking price is $350,000 -- about half the property's current value over the remaining life of the lease, according to a filing by Boo.com.\nPotential tenants for dot-com space are scouring Web sites that track troubled dot-coms so they can contact landlords about space before it goes back on the market.\nMr. Lemle, of Julien J. Studley, said that among real estate agents, dotcomfailures.com, where people post gossip about Internet companies that are likely to fall soon, had become a popular site.\n''It couldn't be better for us and the landlords,'' Mr. Lemle said. ''It is only bad for the tenants who are going out of business.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "The National Academy of Sciences is disputing accusations that reckless experiments by one of its members killed hundreds of South American Indians.\nThe assertions are contained in the book ''Darkness in El Dorado,'' published this month by W. W. Norton & Company. The author, Patrick Tierney, contends that scientists from the United States inoculated thousands of Yanomami Indians in 1968 with a dangerous measles vaccine that set off a deadly epidemic.\nIn a statement last Thursday, the academy, one of the nation's most prestigious scientific bodies, said the book contained multiple factual errors and misstatements.\n''Although 'Darkness in El Dorado' gives the appearance of being well researched, in many instances the author's conclusions are either contradicted or not supported by the references he cites,'' the academy said.\nLast month, an Associated Press article raised similar issues and cited several epidemiologists who said the vaccine given to the Yanomami by Dr. James V. Neel, a University of Michigan geneticist, and his colleagues was proved safe and could not have transmitted measles.\nDr. Neel, who died in February, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1963. ''Darkness in El Dorado'' disparages him as a controversial figure ''whose eugenic views made him a pariah outside his own specialty.''\nIn reality, Dr. Neel was a highly respected scientist and well loved by his colleagues, said Ken Fulton, executive director of membership for the academy.\n''It seemed only right to defend him when he couldn't defend himself,'' Mr. Fulton said.\nReached in Venezuela, Mr. Tierney disagreed vehemently with the academy's statement.\n''I feel it's a gross misrepresentation of what I say in my book,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''There is an element of mystery about the 1968 expedition and the measles epidemic that will never be resolved.''\nThe academy also disputed Mr. Tierney's characterization of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, an organization that studied the long-term health of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs. The commission was not a part of the Atomic Energy Commission, as Mr. Tierney's book says, but an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, which was sometimes at odds with the federal nuclear agency."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Prescription drugs accounted for 44 percent of the increase in health costs last year, researchers said today.\nIn a report published in the journal Health Affairs, the researchers said overall health costs for services covered by private insurance rose by 6.6 percent last year, while drug spending increased by 18.4 percent. The study did not separately examine costs for people without insurance.\nPaul B. Ginsburg, an author of the report, said prescription drugs accounted for more of the 6.6 percent increase in health costs than either hospital care or doctors' services.\n''Drug spending is growing much faster than other components of health care,'' said Mr. Ginsburg, an economist who is president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a private research institute. ''Drug costs are having a bigger and bigger effect on overall health costs.''\nInflation is back after several years of low growth in health insurance premiums, said Mr. Ginsburg, a former director of health care studies at the Congressional Budget Office. The higher premiums mean higher costs for employers and, in many cases, for employees, he said.\nAnother author of the report, Jon R. Gabel, said the resurgence of health care costs was alarming.\n''It appeared that health costs were under control from 1993 to 1997, and even into 1998,'' said Mr. Gabel, a vice president of the Health Research and Educational Trust, a nonprofit group affiliated with the American Hospital Association. Christopher Hogan, a health policy researcher, helped write the report.\nJudith H. Bello, executive vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said she had not read the study and could not comment. But she insisted, ''Prescription drugs are often the most effective and least costly way'' of treating an illness.\nThe rise in prescription drug costs has stimulated interest in proposals to rein in drug prices or add drug benefits to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.\nRepresentative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, has introduced a bill that he said would make prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at the prices negotiated by large government purchasers like the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nMr. Allen and other Democrats complain that elderly people often must pay far more for prescription drugs than do the drug companies' most favored customers, like health maintenance organizations.\nBut a federal appeals court last week upheld the right of pharmacies to charge higher prices for drugs sold to people who are uninsured.\nThe decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, involved Rite Aid drugstores in Alabama. The court said that retail pharmacies had no duty to disclose whether they charged higher prices to uninsured consumers than to insured customers. It said such disparities did not constitute fraud and did not violate the law.\n''Variable pricing is the norm in many industries,'' said the opinion, by Judge Charles R. Wilson. ''Airlines frequently charge different groups of consumers different rates for the same seat, hotels often charge different rates to different consumers for the same room and car dealerships sell identical vehicles for a variety of prices, depending upon the identity (and savvy) of the consumer.''\nThe report in Health Affairs said that about one-third of the increase in drug spending last year was attributable to higher prices. The remainder, it said, was attributable to a higher volume of sales, reflecting the advent of new medicines and the increased use of existing drugs.\nWhile prescription drugs accounted for 44 percent of the increase in health costs last year, the report said, doctors' services accounted for 32 percent, and outpatient hospital care accounted for 21 percent, while inpatient hospital care was responsible for only 3 percent.\nSpending at hospital outpatient clinics grew ''at a consistently high rate throughout the 1990's,'' the report said. By contrast, it said, per capita spending for inpatient services declined in 5 of the last 10 years.\n''The period from 1994 to 1998 was a time of record-low rates of growth in health insurance premiums and in the underlying medical expenses that are covered,'' the article said.\nThe premium for a typical private health insurance plan grew an average of 2 percent a year from 1994 to 1998 -- less than the increase in per capita gross domestic product, the output of goods and services, the authors said. Premiums this year rose an average of 8.3 percent for all businesses and 7.5 percent for companies with 200 or more workers."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The last time Tony Meola played goalkeeper in a World Cup qualifier was Nov. 19, 1989, as a callow American team traveled to Trinidad and Tobago for the most important match the United States men had ever played.\nThe Americans had not qualified for soccer's World Cup in 40 years. Meola was still in college at Virginia and had played only six previous games for the national team. Even if nerves did not threaten to keep him awake the night before the game, the music outside his window did.\n''They had a band outside the hotel all night,'' Meola recalled with a laugh. ''A carnival that they just made up. We slept with earplugs.''\nThe United States won that game, 1-0, and advanced to the World Cup in Italy, for the first time in four decades. Eleven years later, the American men have reached another crossroads. A loss to Barbados on Wednesday might eliminate the United States from the 2002 World Cup finals to be held in Japan and South Korea. The chances of losing appear slim, but a failure to qualify would bring great humiliation to the American men, who are still trying to live down a last-place finish at the 1998 World Cup in France.\nOnce again, Meola will be in goal, his career having been resurrected so thoroughly that he was named most valuable player in Major League Soccer this past season as his team, the Kansas City Wizards, won the title. This time, however, he has not brought along his earplugs.\n''I've got two kids now,'' Meola said. ''I can sleep through anything.''\nIf the Americans cannot defeat Barbados, midfielder Tab Ramos has been telling anyone who will listen, they do not deserve to play in the 2002 World Cup. The United States won the first match, 7-0, in this home-and-away series. Barbados is out of the race now and as few as nine of its players have been showing up for training in recent days.\nEven if the Americans lose Wednesday, they can advance to the final round of qualifying in the region if Guatemala ties or loses at home to Costa Rica on the same day. Three nations from the final round will advance to the World Cup finals. Coach Bruce Arena seems so unconcerned that he did not bother to call in his top two goalkeepers, Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel, from their European club teams.\nStill, as Meola knows better than most, anything can happen in a qualifying match in the Caribbean. First, Arena and the playmaking midfielder Claudio Reyna are serving suspensions for excessive protests after an earlier qualifying match.\nAlso, the ball can take strange bounces on a hard, bumpy field, which describes the playing surface at Barbados's national stadium in Waterford.\nOn the other hand, Meola has never allowed a goal in a World Cup qualifier, so the Americans would appear to be in capable hands. Still, until recently, it seemed unlikely that he would ever get back to this point, playing an important role in a critical match for the national team.\nAfter playing every minute of the American games in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, Meola wandered away from soccer, trying out as a kicker for the Jets, taking a bit part that ended up on the cutting-room floor in a Geena Davis movie and appearing Off Broadway in ''Tony and Tina's Wedding.''\nCoach Steve Sampson ignored him for the 1998 World Cup, then Arena brought him in for three games in 1999. But Meola tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee that year and, at age 30, he saw his career again fall into uncertainty.\n''The knee injury was an eye opener,'' Arena said. ''It had to cross his mind that it might be the end of his career. He realized to get back that he had to do a lot of hard work. He realized this is what he was doing for a living, what he wanted to do for a living.''\nOnce indifferent to running and lifting weights, Meola rehabbed his knee and got the rest of his body into shape. And after moving from the MetroStars to the Wizards in M.L.S., he seemed to mature, restraining himself from screaming at his teammates, taking seriously the responsibility of being team captain.\n''In New York, he wasn't the guy you might want to have behind you,'' Arena said. ''He chewed everyone out. I don't know if he was frustrated from losing, but obviously it was a factor with the MetroStars.''\nSmall blazes are always blown up into bonfires in New York, Meola said. But he conceded, ''I've found a better way to communicate with guys, especially younger guys.''\nIf he makes it to the 2002 World Cup as the third American goalkeeper instead of the first, he would be appreciative, Meola said.\n''You appreciate it a lot more now,'' he said. ''You don't take anything for granted.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Ear Wax\nQ. What is the function of ear wax? Where does it come from?\nA. Ear wax, known to scientists as cerumen (pronounced suh-ROO-mun), traps dust and dirt particles to keep them from going down the ear canal to the eardrum, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology.\nBesides protecting against dirt and water and lubricating the canal, ear wax is slightly acidic, so some experts say it has mild antibacterial properties and helps fight the growth of fungus or bacteria that can cause the outer ear inflammation called swimmer's ear.\nEar wax is formed by small glands under the skin of the outer part of the ear canal. It builds up in different amounts in different people. It may get thicker and drier in old age. Normally, the ear is self-cleaning; the wax gradually dries up, flakes and either falls out or can be gently wiped away.\nIf too much wax accumulates, the traditional warning never to use cotton swabs or other objects to remove it still holds true, because a small instrument can push the wax deeper into the ear canal, against the ear drum, where it can block hearing or injure the drum.\nYour doctor can remove the wax or suggest commercial or homemade drops to soften it. In some cases stronger prescription softeners can be called for. Softeners or even water should never be used without medical advice if a perforated eardrum is suspected, because an infection may result. C. CLAIBORNE RAY"},
{"headline": null, "content": "It is 1987 and Stashu Kybartas has his video camera trained on Danny Sbrochi. Danny's once handsome face is covered with lesions from Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer, and swollen from chemotherapy. Danny revels in the good times -- lying on the beach sunbathing, then cruising for dates, even shooting cocaine and sharing the same needle with five friends -- though the result was AIDS.\nAt a time when gay men like Danny were often portrayed as immoral hedonists who were paying the price for their promiscuity and when people with AIDS were shown on network television with their faces in shadow because of shame and fear, AIDS activists like Mr. Kybartas were busy documenting the epidemic from another perspective.\nThey were making thousands of hours of videotapes: documentaries about the ebbing of young lives, graphic demonstrations of safe sex, records of protests, demonstrations of how to care for the dying and correctives to widespread misinformation.\nNow for the first time many of these videotapes, dating from the late 1980's through the mid-90's, have been collected in a program of screenings at the Guggenheim Museum, titled ''Fever in the Archive: AIDS Activist Videotapes from the Royal S. Marks Collection.'' The program starts on Friday and runs through Dec. 9.\nThe videos, assembled by the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS, a national organization that focuses on the cultural impact of the epidemic, have been donated to the New York Public Library. On Dec. 6, New York University's Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality will hold a panel discussion on the program.\nTo make their videos, the activists often borrowed from the techniques of Dziga Vertov, the Russian filmmaker who was one of the earliest advocates of what is called ''direct cinema.'' A precursor of cinema verite, it was often stripped of ornamentation and voice-over to present an uninflected reality.\nIn ''The Ashes Action'' (1995), by James Wentzy, 15 people deposit the ashes of friends, lovers and relatives who have died of AIDS on the White House lawn. David Robinson, an organizer of the event, speaks to the camera as he holds some ashes.\n''This is what I am left with,'' he says. ''I've got a boxful of ashes and bone chips. There's nothing beautiful in that.''\nThe video artists have adapted the techniques of experimental filmmaking: quick cuts, blurred focuses, metaphoric imagery. In ''Danny,'' for instance, Mr. Kybartas uses long takes of the inhospitable landscape of Steubenville, Ohio, Danny's hometown, as a metaphor for a world that will not accept Danny. Because the artists came of age in the era of music video and MTV, they have also given their work dramatic immediacy with pop music and chanting.\n''The documentaries were produced by people with TV savvy,'' said Gregg Bordowitz, who with Jean Carlomusto made ''Seize Control of the F.D.A.'' in 1988 and himself produced ''Portraits of People Living with H.I.V.,'' a series of videos made between 1991 and 1994. Above all, the filmmakers disdain objectivity and the authoritative narration of traditional television.\nSome video artists have used the methods of dramatic film to convey their message. ''Se Met Ko'' (1989), by Patricia Benoit, about AIDS in the Haitian community, was styled after the Spanish-language soap operas known as telenovelas.\nOther works are essentially video poems. In ''Virus,'' (1994), a meditation on living with H.I.V., the director Stuart Gaffney has his friend, John Lewis, play an old friend ill with AIDS. ''I love to travel, but I couldn't do it now,'' the young man says. ''I'd keep thinking, 'I'm just seeing the world because I'm going to die.' ''\nThe videos were archived by Jim Hubbard, an experimental filmmaker and director of the Estate Project's AIDS Activist Video Preservation Program. Mr. Hubbard traveled around the country, collecting and cataloging tapes. ''Most of the people keep them in closets or under their beds,'' he said. It was imperative to find the videos, which are more fragile than film, so that they could be preserved, he added. Eventually, about 1,000 hours of videotape will be transferred to high-quality analog tape.\nThe videos constitute ''an archive of community response to crisis,'' said Mr. Wentzy, who in the mid-90's produced about 150 tapes for his ''AIDS Community Television'' a public access program in New York City. ''Act Up didn't come out of a vacuum,'' he observed. ''It had a long history of precedents in the labor movement at the turn of the century, in feminism, in the Vietnam War protests. We know those movements through historical documentations.''\nThe tapes also validate the efforts of the protesters, said Catherine (Saalfield) Gund, a member of DIVA (Damned Interfering Video Activist Television), a group affiliated with Act Up. By videotaping the protesters, ''We were saying, 'You were very effective,' '' Ms. Gund remembered. '' 'This is what you were saying, and it makes sense.' ''\nThe AIDS tapes were originally made to fill a perceived gap in the news media's coverage of the epidemic, the filmmakers said. There was little attention paid to the disease in the early days. But Rock Hudson's death from AIDS in 1985 focused attention.\nAt the same time, cheap, portable camcorders were becoming available. Activists began producing videos, including a scattering of programs for public access television. In 1987 Act UP was formed, and one of the earliest tapes in the Guggenheim program, ''Testing the Limits,'' is a record of several demonstrations. With its fast cutting and lack of a traditional voice-over, it provided a blueprint for the future.\nThat same year, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the advocacy and community service group for people with AIDS, hired Ms. Carlomusto, who produced ''The Living With AIDS Show'' on public access television, one of the first programs devoted entirely to the disease. ''We were just trying to break down the stigma,'' she said.\nBut editing videotape was still an expensive process, and the activists begged for and borrowed equipment from public access studios and film schools, and used editing machines at commercial film companies at night, when they weren't being used. Later they obtained equipment from groups like Downtown Community Television.\nIn recent years the number of AIDS videos has dwindled. Some of the activists have died, among them David Wojnarowicz and Phil Zwickler, who made ''Fear of Disclosure,'' a tape about what they called serodiscordant dating: between a man who is H.I.V. positive and one who is negative. Also dead are Costa Pappas and Ray Navarro, members of DIVA, which made ''Target City Hall,'' a videotape of an Act Up demonstration at City Hall, and Kiki Mason, who wrote the text for ''By Any Means Necessary,'' an angry tirade against those standing in the way of a cure for AIDS. Adam Gale, a dancer and performance artist, chronicled his own impending death as one of the makers of ''Rubber Queen: An AIDS Docu-diary,'' a six-part documentary for public access television in Washington.\n''Some really key people died; they just dropped like flies,'' said Mr. Wentzy. And exhaustion set in. ''People got involved because they thought this was going to be solved in a few years,'' he observed. ''They had no idea it would go on such a long time.''\nAnd today ''There are fewer AIDS deaths,'' Mr. Wentzy said, noting the effectiveness of combinations of disease-fighting drugs called protease inhibitors. ''But people are dying on these drugs. People are still getting infected. Only 10 per cent of AIDS patients are covered by health insurance.''\nAIDS activism has also become muted, said Mr. Gaffney, the director of ''Virus,'' because of the changing nature of the sick. ''The people behind the activism were mostly white, middle-class males,'' he said, adding that now ''they are taking their medicine and keeping quiet.''\nSome people went to work for institutions like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and for pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Hubbard said.\nNow, Mr. Gaffney said, the AIDS epidemic has shifted proportionately to a poorer population with a heavy percentage of drug abusers. ''Their lives are not such that they can be activists,'' he said. ''If they have a heroin problem, they're not going to sit through an Act Up meeting.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Even as officials from City Hall and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum enthusiastically described their ambitious plan yesterday for a world-class museum in Lower Manhattan, they said the project faced fund-raising hurdles, a daunting list of governmental reviews and tough scrutiny from the site's neighbors.\nFor the $678 million project to go forward, the City Council has to sign off on it, as do the state and federal governments. The museum, of course, must raise hundreds of millions of dollars to build the project, which will include a performing arts center and public parks and plazas at three East River piers.\nThe environmental impact on the river, the effect on traffic and changes that both supporters and opponents expect in the atmosphere of the waterfront neighborhood are among the concerns that must be addressed before construction starts.\nMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; Thomas Krens, the director of the Guggenheim Foundation; and Frank O. Gehry, the architect, each acknowledged these hurdles yesterday during a ceremony on the Upper East Side at the museum's headquarters, which are one-tenth the size of the proposed museum. They said that at the earliest, construction could start in about two years.\nBut each man also expressed, in sometimes passionate terms, his conviction that the museum is well worth the effort.\n''Civic leaders have a responsibility to leave their city far greater and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''Today's announcement marks another significant step in fulfilling the promise of leaving the city more beautiful than we found it.''\nTo date, no organized or broad-based neighborhood opposition has formed against the plan, which consists of a cloudlike titanium, glass and stone building, supported 80 feet above ground level, leaving room for an outdoor public space below. But the chairwoman of Community Board 1 and several local residents say they have serious reservations about the proposal, with some saying they are committed to blocking it.\n''It would be a disaster,'' said Una L. Perkins, a member of Community Board 1 and chairwoman of the Brooklyn Bridge South Neighborhood Association. ''We don't need any more tall buildings in Lower Manhattan. We need more open space.''\nThere were also clear voices of support in the neighborhood, like Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, who said yesterday that the new museum would be just what downtown needs. The city estimates that it would attract two million to three million visitors a year and generate $280 million in new spending by tourists and others.\n''It would transform downtown into a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week community that we envisioned when we set out to revitalize the area five years ago,'' Mr. Weisbrod said.\nCouncil Speaker Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat who is a contender for mayor, had a relatively tepid reaction to the plan, saying yesterday that there was a need for more study of the city's proposed commitment of $67.8 million worth of assistance; that assistance would entail handing over city-owned land valued at $35 million, as well as $32.8 million in capital contributions.\n''The City Council will ensure that the sizable public property and monetary investment that the city is being asked to make will be in the best interest of the people of New York,'' Mr. Vallone said.\nThe project has at least five major steps to clear before construction could start, according to the City Economic Development Corporation. First, the museum must settle on a final building design and on a plan for the outdoor public space; at this point, the plan for that space calls for an ice-skating rink, a riverfront promenade and a public park, and much of it would be underneath the building, which would be supported on stilts.\nMr. Gehry said he expected many changes, in part based on the reaction by local residents or others, so much so that he said he could even see abandoning the titanium exterior surface that is now so central to the preliminary design.\n''Don't fix yourself on that,'' Mr. Gehry said yesterday. ''The important urban idea is to make a building like this fit into the fabric of this great city.'' He added, ''It has a persona, and it is important that the new building fit into that persona, not mimic it, not copy it, but become a good neighborhood to it.''\nState and federal environmental reviews must be completed before permits can be issued by the State Department of Environmental Conservation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The city and the museum must reach final lease terms for the land, and the City Council would have to vote on the proposed city money for the project.\nA series of special city land-use and zoning permits related to waterfront access and to the bulk of the building are needed, requiring review and votes by Community Board 1, the Manhattan Borough Board, the Planning Commission and the City Council, as well as the signature of the mayor. Even the Metropolitan Transportation Authority must decide whether to sign off because the museum would be on top of one of its subway tunnels.\nMadelyn G. Wils, chairwoman of Community Board 1, said that the board had not yet taken a position on the proposal, but that initially, she thought that the building would be far too large for the site. ''It is so big that looking north from below it, you could not even see the Brooklyn Bridge,'' she said, adding that it would cause unacceptable traffic congestion.\nMuseum officials said they were ready to listen. Mr. Krens estimated that the museum's opening was five or six years away. ''It is going to be a long process,'' he said. ''A process that by necessity and by design will involve the local community.''\nThe museum needs a total of about $1 billion for the project: $678 million for the construction and about $300 million for an endowment. Of the private money that it needs, the museum says it has raised about a third, but the remaining money needed far exceeds the $144 million that was collected during its last major capital campaign.\nEven with these large numbers, museum officials said that given the prestige of the project, they were confident that they could raise the money.\nMs. Wils and one City Council staff member said yesterday that despite all of the enthusiasm by the mayor and museum officials about the project, major delays had been common in large public-private ventures. For example, Battery Park City was first conceived in 1966, but its first tenants did not move in until 1982.\n''I am not going to say it is not going to happen,'' Ms. Wils said. ''But it is going to take a much longer time than they think it will. Not 5 years. I think maybe 10.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "Faced with mounting losses from sagging cranberry prices, a group of growers sued the Ocean Spray Cranberries cooperative yesterday in an attempt to force its board to explore selling the company.\nFor the second consecutive year, cranberry farmers will earn far less for a crop than it takes to grow one. A surfeit of the fruit has driven prices down to less than $11 this fall from a high of $80 a barrel in 1996.\nThat is less than one-third of what it costs to produce each barrel. The difference is squeezing growers, with some having to sell land to avert off bankruptcy.\n''I've never seen anything even remotely similar to this,'' said J. Garfield DeMarco, a former Ocean Spray director who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Mr. DeMarco, Ocean Spray's third-largest shareholder, has operated about 800 acres of cranberry bogs in New Jersey since 1965.\n''A sale may be the only way for many growers to survive,'' Mr. DeMarco said. Since Ocean Spray began in 1930, it has functioned as a cooperative, owned by the farmers who grow cranberries for juices and sauces. Although their investment has never appreciated in value -- the cooperative sets the price of each share at $25 -- the farmers have been assured a buyer for their harvests, in good years and bad.\nThe cooperative faced few competitors in its first 60 years, permitting it to offer relatively stable returns for growers. But the industry changed drastically in the early 1990's, when a group of growers split from the cooperative to form Northland Cranberries, now Ocean Spray's biggest competitor.\nThen, in 1994, a Harvard University study showed that cranberry juice soothed urinary tract infections, creating a boom for the industry.\nRacing to meet an increase in demand for cranberry juice, Ocean Spray's bogs grew to 50,000 acres in the 1990's from 30,000. A burgeoning generic cranberry business emerged as well, prompting independent growers to increase their acreage by 176 percent over the same period.\nBut by 1999, when the new bogs yielded a record harvest, the supply had surpassed demand. Ocean Spray now has nearly enough berries in storage to last a full year without growing additional crops.\nAlthough the Agriculture Department recently ordered Ocean Spray and Northland to scale back production this year, growers say that effort will do little to ease their pain. And while Ocean Spray officials say the company is in the midst of a turnaround, with aggressive advertising and expansion into overseas markets, they acknowledge that it may take until 2002 to raise the price of cranberries to the break-even point.\nBy that time, the lawsuit asserts, most growers ''are likely to be forced out of business.'' Yet through a sale or merger of the company, the plaintiffs say, the farmers' shares will be valued at significantly more than $25.\nOcean Spray's board considered the issue last year but, to the ire of many growers, voted against it and announced a reorganization of the company instead.\nTo help arrive at a decision, the board hired Merrill Lynch and Bain & Company to determine what the company would be worth in the event of a sale and how well it would fare without one. Those reports have never been released to shareholders, but former board members have said the studies urged that a sale be considered and estimated the value of each share at $300 or more.\nIf successful, the lawsuit would not force Ocean Spray's board to sell the company. Instead, it would permit shareholders, through a vote at their annual meeting in January, to require the board to set a target price for the company and draft a sketch of what it would look like after a sale.\nCompany officials said they had already agreed to put such resolutions before the shareholders, under pressure from the large growers.\nBut the lawsuit also touches on other, potentially more controversial points. Not only could it order the board to release the consultants' reports -- which would cause a groundswell of support for a sale, the plaintiffs say -- but it would permit shareholders to vote on whether board members should actively seek suitors for a potential merger."},
{"headline": null, "content": "It seemed like the perfect solution. Build more prisons and America would be a safer place. In fact, as the nation's incarceration rate has quadrupled over the last two decades, the crime rate has fallen for eight straight years.\nBut only now are politicians and criminologists beginning to confront an unexpected consequence of the get-tough-on-crime philosophy that created the prison-building boom. More prisoners in prison means that, eventually, more prisoners will be let out. This year, a record 600,000 inmates will be released from state and federal prisons nationwide, up from 170,000 in 1980.\nAs the former prisoners return, largely to the poor neighborhoods of large cities, there is mounting evidence that they represent what some criminologists and prison officials now call the collateral damage of the prison-building boom.\nBecause states sharply curtailed education, job training and other rehabilitation programs inside prisons, the newly released inmates are far less likely than their counterparts two decades ago to find jobs, maintain stable family lives or stay out of the kind of trouble that leads to more prison. Many states have unintentionally contributed to these problems by abolishing early release for good behavior, removing the incentive for inmates to improve their conduct, the experts say.\nIn addition, parole officers are quicker to revoke a newly released inmate's parole for minor violations, like failing a drug test, meaning more inmates are returned to prison time and again, creating what some experts say is a self-perpetuating prison class. In California, for example, 68 percent of the people admitted to prison last year were on parole at the time they were sent back, up from only 21 percent in 1980, according to the California Department of Corrections.\nEvidence of the troubles posed by the large number of returning prisoners is beginning to show up across the nation.\nIn Boston, which has had one of the largest declines in crime of any major city, the police superintendent, Paul Joyce, said that newly released inmates were a major reason for a 13 percent increase in firearms-related crimes in the first half of the year. Mr. Joyce said part of the reason was that the former inmates brought prison grudges or gang affiliations back to the streets.\nIn Tallahassee, Fla., Todd Clear and Dina Rose, a husband and wife team of criminologists, have found that the crime rate in poor neighborhoods rises as the number of newly released inmates increases. Family and financial pressures often are the cause, they say -- including the pressure to pay the $50 to $150 the state charges them for their own supervision.\nCalifornia Led the Way\nAlthough law enforcement experts say that the large number of inmates being returned to prisons is a nationwide phenomenon, nowhere is it more striking than in California, the state with the largest prison population and the first state to abolish flexible sentences, which historically led to early release for good behavior.\nIn California, four out of five former inmates returned to prison were sent back not for committing new crimes but for technical violations of the terms of their parole; for example, failing a drug test or missing appointments with parole agents.\nThe state retains the authority to supervise released offenders even though they serve their full sentences. The parole supervision normally lasts three years, barring other infractions. Some of these returning inmates have been to prison 10 times. (The so-called three-strike law, which puts a habitual offender in prison for 25 years to life, does not apply to parole violations.)\nWithout such a high rate of return of parolees, studies have shown, California's prison population would have declined, not grown, as crime dropped in the 1990's.\nThe difficulties that inmates face on release showed up in a report last year by the California State Legislative Analyst's Office: 85 percent of released prisoners in California are drug or alcohol abusers, 70 percent to 80 percent are still jobless after a year, 50 percent are illiterate and 10 percent are homeless. Nationwide, the figures are similar. Allen J. Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department, said 82 percent of people on parole who are returned to prison are drug or alcohol abusers, 40 percent are unemployed, about 75 percent have not completed high school and 19 percent are homeless.\nOther reports have found that 20 percent of inmates nationwide suffer from severe mental illness, like schizophrenia or depression. In addition, almost one-quarter of all people infected with the AIDS virus and more than one-third of those with tuberculosis were released from prison or jail in the past year, according to a new study by Theodore Hammett, of Abt Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.\n''When most Americans think of the surge in the prison population, they think it has reduced crime and that makes them more secure,'' said Joan Petersilia, a professor of criminology at the University of California at Irvine, a leading authority on parole. ''What they forget is that 97 percent of prisoners will be released, and the more times a person has been to prison before, the more likely they are to be rearrested, because things like finding housing and jobs and re-establishing family ties become harder and harder for them.''\nThe problem is not that individual criminals are committing more crime, Mr. Beck said, but that the pool of potential criminals has grown. ''What's worrisome,'' he said, ''is that because we've got more and more people coming out of prison, more and more people are failing, so the risk to the community has increased dramatically.''\nTake three recent California cases, drawn from official records and interviews with the former inmates:\nAntoine Mahan, 33, was released from prison after serving four years for burglary, the last two in solitary confinement. After releasing him directly from solitary confinement, the prison gave him the customary $200 in ''gate money,'' which was supposed to help him start a new life, then drove him to the train station for the trip home to San Francisco.\nBut Mr. Mahan described himself as a crack addict with the AIDS virus and a diagnosis of manic depression, though he received no drug or psychiatric treatment while in prison, he said. By the time the train reached San Francisco, it was evening, too late, he recalled in an interview, for the required check-in with his parole agent, so, he said, he broke into a McDonald's to sleep and resumed selling and taking drugs. So far, he remains out on parole.\nAnd there is Steven Butler, 44, who was released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for possession of cocaine. Records show he was given his $200 and a bus ticket back to Los Angeles, where he had been arrested.\nBut Mr. Butler was homeless at the time of his arrest, with no family here, so the first night after getting off the bus, he said, he went back to sleeping on the same skid-row street just east of downtown where he had lived before. With no education, job skills or hope, he said, he used some of his money to buy dope to make himself feel better.\nThere is also Sam Watland, a 33-year-old from coastal San Luis Obisbo who looks like the surfer he once was. He has been released on parole nine times in the last decade: three times after serving sentences for embezzlement, auto theft and assault, and six times after parole revocations. He has had his parole revoked so many times, and so quickly -- once he lasted only 14 days on the outside -- that the day before his most recent release from prison, he had nightmares he would get picked up again.\nCalifornia parole agents have become quicker since the early 1980's to revoke paroles, sending people back to prison for violations of the conditions of their release, said C. A. Terhune, who recently retired as the director of the Department of Corrections. Mr. Terhune said that was a response to ''the current public climate'' to get tougher on criminals, tightening the conditions for parole. With improved urine tests, for example, it is easier for parole officers to catch drug use.\nA growing number of prison officials and criminologists say they question whether this drive to revoke parole so quickly is good public policy or whether it simply drives up costs and diverts money from more effective treatment programs.\n''I'd have fewer inmates if there weren't parole officers whacking so many guys back,'' said Martin F. Horn, Pennsylvania's secretary of corrections.\n3-Time Parole Violator\nJason Peterson had lost 60 pounds when he was released after spending almost two years in solitary confinement at Pelican Bay, California's super maximum-security prison, while serving a sentence for possession of a pipe bomb.\nWhen he returned to his mother's house in San Francisco, after months without human contact, he refused to leave his bedroom, his mother, Jeannine Peterson, said in a lengthy interview recently. Her account was supported by her son's lawyer and a psychiatrist hired by the family.\nConcerned about his mental state, Mrs. Peterson, an elementary school special education teacher, called his parole officer, who offered to take him to the hospital. Instead, she said, the parole officer arrived with police officers, who handcuffed her son and took him into custody.\nThe next morning, the parole agent called to say that Mr. Peterson's parole had been revoked for psychiatric reasons and he had been given an additional year in prison at San Quentin, his mother said.\nMrs. Peterson hired a lawyer, Graham Noyes, who demanded a parole revocation hearing, and a psychiatrist, Terry Kupers, to examine her son. Mr. Noyes and Dr. Kupers said they were excluded from participating in the revocation hearing.\nThe issue of providing lawyers for inmates in parole revocation hearings is the subject of a class-action suit pending against the California Department of Corrections in Federal District Court in Sacramento. The inmates contend that under rulings by the United States Supreme Court in the 1970's, they are entitled to such representation. The corrections department generally allows lawyers in parole revocation hearings only if the inmate is deemed mentally impaired. Inmates may not call witnesses or exclude hearsay evidence.\nHearings are presided over by a deputy commissioner of the Board of Prison Terms, a branch of the Department of Corrections, who serves as both judge and jury.\nThe deputy commissioner in Mr. Peterson's case found him to be psychotic and a danger to others, and sentenced him to the additional year in prison, according to department records.\nSince then, Mr. Peterson has become an apprentice plumber, but he has had his parole revoked three more times, department records show. Once it was revoked for possession of a dangerous weapon -- a serious issue to the department, given his original conviction -- though his mother and lawyer say it was only a plumber's knife his parole agent found in his toolbox when the agent searched Mr. Peterson's truck.\nThe next time it was again for possession of a dangerous weapon, what the parole agent described as a hand grenade in Mr. Peterson's bedroom. Mr. Peterson's sister said it was actually a toy grenade she had bought for her Halloween costume.\nThen last spring Mr. Peterson was charged with assault and making a terrorist threat when he got into an argument with a former girlfriend, who he said had been harassing his current girlfriend. A department spokesman said the former girlfriend's mother testified against him, but Mr. Peterson's boss in the plumber's union, who tried to testify for him, was excluded from the hearing.\nSo far, Mr. Peterson has spent a year and 11 months in prison on parole revocations, almost as long as he did on his original two-year sentence. And the total could go on almost indefinitely, because under California law, each time Mr. Peterson has his parole revoked, he stops earning credit toward his original three-year parole term. The parole revocations themselves, in California, can last from a few weeks to a year.\nIn support of the quick parole-revocation policy, Jerome Marsh, the assistant regional director of parole for southern California, said, ''Our No. 1 priority now is public safety,'' not the more historical goal of trying to help keep offenders from going back to prison.\nParole Disappears\nIt was not always this way.\nIn 1977, only 788 inmates who had been released on parole were returned to prison in California, compared with 90,000 in 1999.\nAt that time, most inmates across the nation served flexible sentences, say 5 to 10 years, and parole boards appointed by governors had discretion in determining when prisoners were ready for release, usually when they could show they had rehabilitated themselves or had a job or family waiting for them. Prison officials approved of parole, because it encouraged inmates to improve and helped maintain order.\nBut California led a sweeping national change in 1977 when it became the first state to take away the power of the parole board and eliminated flexible sentences, replacing them with fixed terms determined in advance by a judge. Under the new system, inmates were automatically released at the end of their term without review by a parole board, though after their release they were still on parole.\nThe switch came in reaction to the explosion of violent crime in the late 1960's and early 1970's and an unusual agreement by liberals and conservatives that discretionary release on parole was a failure. Liberals complained that parole boards were too influenced by an inmate's race, leading to longer time served for blacks. Conservatives attacked parole boards for letting criminals out too early.\nUnfortunately, Professor Petersilia said, ''When we adopted fixed sentences, there is no longer any incentive for prisoners to reform, just as there is no way to judge whether their behavior has improved.''\nMoreover, although in California newly released inmates are still monitored by parole agents, in many states inmates who ''max out,'' in prison slang, are simply allowed to walk out without any further monitoring, sometimes directly from solitary confinement. Nationwide, of the 600,000 inmates to be released this year, 100,000 will be unsupervised, according to Mr. Beck of the Justice Department.\nAt the same time, the public was calling for a get-tough approach to crime, and many prison rehabilitation programs were eliminated. They included classes, vocational training and halfway houses, where inmates could adjust to the outside world by working regular jobs in the day and staying in supervised housing at night. The money saved went to building more prisons.\nAccording to a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of state prison inmates participating in drug treatment programs dropped to 1 in 10 in 1997 from 1 in 4 in 1991. At the same time, many states, including New York, have stopped allowing inmates to take college extension courses, which were once very popular, and Congress prohibited inmates from receiving Pell grants to pay for college class tuition, said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington.\nNow, only 9 percent of prisoners are in full-time job training or education programs, while 24 percent are completely idle, said James Austin, director of the Institute on Crime, Justice and Corrections at George Washington University.\nBruce Western, a professor of sociology at Princeton University, has found that even when paroled inmates are able to find jobs, they earn only half as much as people of the same social and economic background who have not been incarcerated.\nWilliam Sabol, a senior researcher at Case Western Reserve University, said, ''That makes parolees less capable of forming stable relationships and supporting families, and therefore more likely to engage in illegal activities.''\nSimilarly, men who have been imprisoned and paroled will have a harder time supervising their children, Mr. Sabol said, making their offspring more likely to get into trouble. Several other studies have found that half of all teenagers in juvenile prisons have parents who have been incarcerated.\nIn Tallahassee, Professors Clear and Rose found neighborhoods where everyone had at least one friend or relative who had been in prison.\nFlorida is one of 13 states that now permanently take away the right to vote from anyone convicted of a felony. This is another factor that tends to alienate former prisoners from being a part of society, the experts say.\nAnother pitfall for former inmates is that even when they do try to succeed, the get-tough movement has made it hard for them to find jobs, with recent laws barring them from certain occupations. In California, parolees are legally banned from working in law, real estate, medicine, nursing, physical therapy and education. Harriet Davis of Berkeley got out of prison in 1986, after serving three years for shooting a man who beat her, and then earned a college nursing degree and passed the registered-nurse licensing test. But the new California law barring ex-felons from nursing has left her to scrape by as a stock room clerk or home care aid, or sometimes on welfare.\nThe growing number of inmates returned to prison carries a cost to taxpayers as well. Nationwide, in the 1990's, the number of criminals sent to state prisons rose 22.7 percent, to 565,291 in 1998, up from 460,739 in 1990, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But the number of new criminals sent to state prisons rose only 7.5 percent, while the number of inmates returned to prison, either for parole violations or for committing new crimes while on parole, jumped 54.4 percent, to account for the bulk of the growth in prison inmates.\nProblems, Solutions\nThe cases of Ruth Ann Clements and Raul Morales, drawn from interviews and court papers, illustrate the perils of release and a hope for the future.\nMs. Clements had no family or friends in Stockton, the agricultural city where her parole officer took her last spring, putting her in a rundown residential hotel after she had served 10 years in Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, the last four years in solitary confinement, for stabbing her boyfriend to death.\nHer parents are dead. Her four children were scattered around the country -- one was in a juvenile prison in Louisiana for being a runaway. Her years in solitary left Ms. Clements, 43, depressed, anxious and disconnected from the world, she and her lawyer, Casandra Shaylor, said.\nA prison doctor had prescribed Prozac and Buspar for her depression and anxiety, but when she was released she was not given a supply of the drugs, as required by state law.\nPrison officials declined to comment on why she was denied the drugs, citing privacy concerns.\n''I get overwhelmed easily now,'' Ms. Clements said recently, sitting in her small room in the residential hotel, filled with other drug addicts and parolees, put there by the authorities.\nEven cooking a meal was hard, she said, since she had not cooked in 10 years. She did not have a car or a driver's license -- it expired long ago -- and she did not know how to get a new one or to find her way around Stockton. Discouraged, she made no effort to find work.\nIn September, Ms. Clements was charged with drinking and battery, violations of the conditions of her parole, according to the Department of Corrections, after she and a man in the residence got into an argument. She is now back in prison, her parole revoked, with an additional term of 10 months.\nHer daughter Amber, 16, who had been released from juvenile prison in Louisiana and put on a bus to Stockton, has been placed in foster care.\n''So much for the belief that families should be put back together,'' her mother wrote in a letter from prison.\nRaul Morales has a better chance, thanks to a new official awareness that the prison and parole systems are leading to failure.\nA 34-year-old heroin addict from East Los Angeles, Mr. Morales has been sent to prison five times for convictions for drug possession and burglary, and eight times for parole violations. (His early convictions were before enactment of the three-strike law.)\nHeroin was all he knew, Mr. Morales said, explaining, ''My dad and grandfather did heroin, and so I did heroin with them.''\nPrison did not change his drug habit. ''It says Department of Corrections, but there was no corrections,'' Mr. Morales said. ''You do your time, then you get out, and then you go back to drugs.''\nBut in his most recent incarceration, he found himself in Corcoran State Prison in a new drug treatment program run by Phoenix House, which has a contract with the California Department of Corrections. As he was about to be released, he agreed to enroll in a continuing program administered by Phoenix House in an old apartment building on the boardwalk in Venice, an ocean-front section of Los Angeles. To make sure he did not slip, a Phoenix House van picked him up at the gate outside Corcoran and drove him there.\nThe Venice building contained 50 beds, with a view of the Pacific, and group therapy, a 12-step self-help program, anger-management classes, vocational training and free medical care. After six months, the former inmates are supposed to be ready to go out on their own.\n''It's not easy,'' said Howard Friend, the director. ''When you go for a job application, you have to tell them you've been in prison, and then you often don't get called back.''\nThe Phoenix House program in Corcoran is too new to have been evaluated. But a study of a similar program at the R. J. Donovan Prison in San Diego found that of inmates who completed treatment in prison and then went through an after-care program in the community, like Phoenix House, only 27 percent were returned to prison after three years. By comparison, in a control group of inmates who did not participate in treatment, or refused after-care, 75 percent ended up back in prison.\nThat is a surprising result, California officials say. The drug treatment program reversed almost exactly the state's overall recidivism rate of nearly 70 percent of inmates ending up back in prison.\nIt could be such success stories that led California voters to approve, over the strong opposition of virtually all law enforcement officials, a referendum that will change the state's approach to drug violations. The ballot measure calls for first-time drug offenders and parolees found using drugs to be provided treatment instead of being sent to prison."},

It could help solve one of the central mysteries in Dr. Lee's case: what happened to the 3M brand DC 6150 computer tape cartridges on which the highly sensitive weapons information was illegally placed.\nOfficials close to the case said that the government has known since Sept. 13, when Dr. Lee entered a plea to one felony count, that he put the tapes in the garbage, and that they probably ended up in the landfill. But it was unclear why it has taken agents more than two months to begin digging.\nDoug Beldon, an F.B.I. special supervisory agent in Albuquerque, would say only, ''The F.B.I. is conducting a search at a Los Alamos, N.M., landfill in furtherance of an ongoing investigation.''\nBut government officials confirmed that the goal was to locate Dr. Lee's computer tapes.\nJohn Cline, a lawyer for Dr. Lee, said he would have no comment.\nDr. Lee, a former weapons scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, had originally been charged in a 59-count indictment with illegally downloading a trove of weapons data with the intention of aiding a foreign nation and harming the United States.\nDr. Lee spent more than nine months in solitary confinement and was described as a grave risk to national security. But the government dropped almost its entire case and Dr. Lee pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling secrets.\nDr. Lee won his freedom and agreed to explain why he had downloaded the data and what happened to the tapes, at least seven of which were missing. His lawyers had said earlier that he destroyed the missing tapes and that no one else had access to them.\nDr. Lee has had eight meetings with government officials over the past two months, and two more are expected in mid-December.\nOfficials said that during the sessions Dr. Lee told officials that he had put the tapes in the garbage at the laboratory. Government agents were then able to determine roughly what part of the landfill they were emptied into, and that is where the F.B.I. now intends to begin its search.\nThe tapes are regarded by the government as being of vital importance -- in court hearings they were said to have information that could allow another nation to create nuclear bombs -- and have been the focus of an enormous government investigation, both to preserve them and to keep them from falling into enemy hands.\nThe tapes contain, or at least had once contained, a virtual library of nuclear weapons testing and design data, and Dr. Lee had created them over a period of years."},

{"headline": null, "content": "Tofu vs. Cream Cheese\nQ. My corner deli offers a variety of tofu spreads, which I enjoy with my morning bagel, believing them to be a healthful, less-fattening alternative to cream cheese or even fat-free cream cheese. Am I correct, and what is it exactly that I am eating?\nA. While tofu spreads can be a good alternative for those who are looking to avoid all cholesterol, lactose, dairy or animal products, they are not necessarily low-fat or more healthful than cream cheese.\nTofu spreads are made from a mix of tofu, water, sugar, salt, partly hydrogenated soybean oil and soy protein, plus preservatives, stabilizers and flavorings. They vary in fat content from full-fat to low-fat (the fat comes from the tofu itself and the oil). Full-fat tofu spread (the kind usually offered in New York delis) has, per ounce, 8 grams of fat, 2 of which are saturated; no cholesterol; 80 calories; and 1 gram of protein. Reduced-fat tofu spread has 4 grams of fat, 1 of which is saturated; no cholesterol; 40 calories; and 1 gram of protein.\nRegular cream cheese has, per ounce, 10 grams of fat, 6 of which are saturated; 31 milligrams of cholesterol; 99 calories; and 2 grams of protein. Light cream cheese, or Neufchatel, contains 6 grams of fat, 4 of which are saturated; 20 milligrams of cholesterol; 70 calories; and 3 grams of protein. If you want the lowest fat, fewest calories and highest protein, though, your best bet is to smear your bagel with fat-free cream cheese: it has no fat, 5 milligrams of cholesterol, 25 calories and 5 grams of protein.\nThe Sesame Difference\nQ. What is Asian sesame paste? Is it different from the Middle Eastern sesame paste called tahini? Where can I buy it?\nA. Asian sesame paste is different from tahini, and they are not interchangeable. While both are made from ground sesame seeds, the Asian paste uses toasted seeds and tahini raw ones. As a result, the Asian product has a potent, nutty flavor and a grainy texture similar to natural peanut butter; the tahini is mild and creamy.\nAsian sesame paste is usually thinned with liquid or oil, then used to dress noodles, salads and vegetables. It is available in Asian and specialty markets, including Katagiri (224 East 59th Street; 212-755-3566) for $6.15 for a 5.2-ounce jar.\nVodka to the Rescue\nQ. Since vodka is tasteless and most of its alcohol evaporates in cooking, what do you gain by adding vodka to a tomato sauce for pasta?\nA. The alcohol in the vodka enhances the flavor of the tomatoes. Some flavors are alcohol-soluble, meaning that they will be released only by the addition of alcohol. Vodka can help bring out these flavors without contributing another flavor, as wine or brandy would.\nSo a tomato sauce made with a touch of vodka can be slightly more intense than one made without. This is a particular boon if you are using less than perfectly ripe, late-summer tomatoes, which may need that flavor boost.\nClementines Do the Job\nQ. When they are in season, I often eat at least four clementines a day. Am I getting as many nutrients from these fun little fruits as when I eat a more ''serious'' citrus fruit like a grapefruit?\nA. Clementines, those diminutive, easy-to-peel citrus fruits in the mandarin family, are quite nutritious, especially if you eat four a day. Compared with a similar-sized serving of grapefruit (100 grams), clementines have twice as much fiber, approximately 20 percent more calories (if you don't sprinkle sugar on your grapefruit) and only a little less vitamin C.

{"headline": null, "content": "Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today striking down police roadblocks for drug searches. The vote in Indianapolis v. Edmund was 6 to 3. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion; Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the dissent.\nFROM THE DECISION\nBy Justice O'Connor\nWe have never approved a checkpoint program whose primary purpose was to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing. Rather, our checkpoint cases have recognized only limited exceptions to the general rule that a seizure must be accompanied by some measure of individualized suspicion. We suggested in Prouse [v. Delaware] (1979) that we would not credit the ''general interest in crime control'' as justification for a regime of suspicionless stops. Consistent with this suggestion, each of the checkpoint programs that we have approved was designed primarily to serve purposes closely related to the problems of policing the border or the necessity of ensuring roadway safety. Because the primary purpose of the Indianapolis narcotics checkpoint program is to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing, the program contravenes the Fourth Amendment.\nPetitioners propose several ways in which the narcotics-detection purpose of the instant checkpoint program may instead resemble the primary purposes of the checkpoints in [Michigan v.] Sitz (1990) and [United States v.] Martinez-Fuerte (1976). Petitioners state that the checkpoints in those cases had the same ultimate purpose of arresting those suspected of committing crimes. Securing the border and apprehending drunk drivers are, of course, law enforcement activities, and law enforcement officers employ arrests and criminal prosecutions in pursuit of these goals. If we were to rest the case at this high level of generality, there would be little check on the ability of the authorities to construct roadblocks for almost any conceivable law enforcement purpose. Without drawing the line at roadblocks designed primarily to serve the general interest in crime control, the Fourth Amendment would do little to prevent such intrusions from becoming a routine part of American life.\nPetitioners also emphasize the severe and intractable nature of the drug problem as justification for the checkpoint program. There is no doubt that traffic in illegal narcotics creates social harms of the first magnitude. The law enforcement problems that the drug trade creates likewise remain daunting and complex, particularly in light of the myriad forms of spinoff crime that it spawns. The same can be said of various other illegal activities, if only to a lesser degree. But the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose. Rather, in determining whether individualized suspicion is required, we must consider the nature of the interests threatened and their connection to the particular law enforcement practices at issue. We are particularly reluctant to recognize exceptions to the general rule of individualized suspicion where governmental authorities primarily pursue their general crime control ends.\nNor can the narcotics-interdiction purpose of the checkpoints be rationalized in terms of a highway safety concern similar to that present in Sitz. The detection and punishment of almost any criminal offense serves broadly the safety of the community, and our streets would no doubt be safer but for the scourge of illegal drugs. Only with respect to a smaller class of offenses, however, is society confronted with the type of immediate, vehicle-bound threat to life and limb that the sobriety checkpoint in Sitz was designed to eliminate. . . .\nThe primary purpose of the Indianapolis narcotics checkpoints is in the end to advance ''the general interest in crime control.'' We decline to suspend the usual requirement of individualized suspicion where the police seek to employ a checkpoint primarily for the ordinary enterprise of investigating crimes. We cannot sanction stops justified only by the generalized and ever present possibility that interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given motorist has committed some crime.\nOf course, there are circumstances that may justify a law enforcement checkpoint where the primary purpose would otherwise, but for some emergency, relate to ordinary crime control. For example, as the Court of Appeals noted, the Fourth Amendment would almost certainly permit an appropriately tailored roadblock set up to thwart an imminent terrorist attack or to catch a dangerous criminal who is likely to flee by way of a particular route. . . .\nPetitioners argue that our prior cases preclude an inquiry into the purposes of the checkpoint program. For example, they cite Whren v. United States (1996) and Bond v. United States (2000) to support the proposition that ''where the government articulates and pursues a legitimate interest for a suspicionless stop, courts should not look behind that interest to determine whether the government's 'primary purpose' is valid.'' These cases, however, do not control the instant situation.\nIn Whren, we held that an individual officer's subjective intentions are irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment validity of a traffic stop that is justified objectively by probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. We observed that our prior cases ''foreclose any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved.'' . . . Last term in Bond v. United States (2000), we addressed the question whether a law enforcement officer violated a reasonable expectation of privacy in conducting a tactile examination of carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment of a bus. In doing so, we simply noted that the principle of Whren rendered the subjective intent of an officer irrelevant to this analysis. While, as petitioners correctly observe, the analytical rubric of Bond was not ''ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis,'' nothing in Bond suggests that we would extend the principle of Whren to all situations where individualized suspicion was lacking. . . .\nFROM THE DISSENT\nBy Chief Justice Rehnquist\nThe state's use of a drug-sniffing dog, according to the court's holding, annuls what is otherwise plainly constitutional under our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: brief, standardized, discretionless, roadblock seizures of automobiles, seizures which effectively serve a weighty state interest with only minimal intrusion on the privacy of their occupants. Because these seizures serve the state's accepted and significant interests of preventing drunken driving and checking for driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, and because there is nothing in the record to indicate that the addition of the dog sniff lengthens these otherwise legitimate seizures, I dissent.\n. . . Roadblock seizures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment if they are ''carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.'' Specifically, the constitutionality of a seizure turns upon ''a weighing of the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.'' . . .\nThis case follows naturally from Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz. Petitioners acknowledge that the ''primary purpose'' of these roadblocks is to interdict illegal drugs, but this fact should not be controlling. Even accepting the court's conclusion that the checkpoints at issue in Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz were not primarily related to criminal law enforcement, the question whether a law enforcement purpose could support a roadblock seizure is not presented in this case. The district court found that another ''purpose of the checkpoints is to check driver's licenses and vehicle registrations,'' and the written directives state that the police officers are to ''look for signs of impairment.'' The use of roadblocks to look for signs of impairment was validated by Sitz, and the use of roadblocks to check for driver's licenses and vehicle registrations was expressly recognized in Delaware v. Prouse (1979). That the roadblocks serve these legitimate state interests cannot be seriously disputed, as the 49 people arrested for offenses unrelated to drugs can attest. And it would be speculative to conclude given the district court's findings, the written directives, and the actual arrests that petitioners would not have operated these roadblocks but for the state's interest in interdicting drugs.\nBecause of the valid reasons for conducting these roadblock seizures, it is constitutionally irrelevant that petitioners also hoped to interdict drugs. . . .\nThe reasonableness of highway checkpoints, at issue here, turns on whether they effectively serve a significant state interest with minimal intrusion on motorists. The stop in Whren was objectively reasonable because the police officers had witnessed traffic violations; so too the roadblocks here are objectively reasonable because they serve the substantial interests of preventing drunken driving and checking for driver's licenses and vehicle registrations with minimal intrusion on motorists. . . .\nWith these checkpoints serving two important state interests, the remaining prongs of the Brown v. Texas (1997) balancing test are easily met. The seizure is objectively reasonable as it lasts, on average, two to three minutes and does not involve a search. The subjective intrusion is likewise limited as the checkpoints are clearly marked and operated by uniformed officers who are directed to stop every vehicle in the same manner. The only difference between this case and Sitz is the presence of the dog. . . .\nThese stops effectively serve the state's legitimate interests; they are executed in a regularized and neutral manner; and they only minimally intrude upon the privacy of the motorists. They should therefore be constitutional."},

{"headline": null, "content": "If there is any doubt that Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy is serious about enlisting corporations as active partners in New York City's public schools, Fredda L. Plesser is eager to dispel it.\nWith a grateful nod toward the myriad nonprofit agencies that already have established programs linking corporate executives, their time and their money with city schools, Ms. Plesser said she believed that there was far, far more to be done.\nOh, and one other thing. ''We don't say 'Adopt a school,' '' explained Ms. Plesser, the Board of Education's chief executive of the newly created office for corporate partnerships. She added: ''We're talking about a partnership, a two-way relationship, with full corporate and employee involvement. That's more of the goal here.''\nThe Board of Education wants every one of its nearly 1,200 schools to be matched with a company that will donate employees' time to work with students, faculty and administrators in whatever types of programs fit both the company's skills and the school's needs.\nIn addition to mentoring students, those efforts by corporations, as envisioned by Ms. Plesser, will include internships or paid work experiences for students at the participating companies; help to improve physical facilities such as gymnasiums, libraries, auditoriums and classrooms; donations of resources like computers, laboratory equipment and books; establishment of health and physical education programs; and efforts to reach out to parents.\nMoney, too, is a part of the effort -- a big part. According to Ms. Plesser, Mr. Levy wants corporate donations to fund large programs to help teachers develop their instructional skills, teach management skills to principals and their assistants, and provide the means for school leaders to share ideas for handling school problems.\nTens of millions of dollars of private-sector donations will be sought to help pay for and manage Mr. Levy's ambitious teacher-training program, Ms. Plesser said.\nThe New York City Teaching Fellows program, a fast-track effort to attract teaching candidates from other professions and train them on the job, costs the Board of Education $15,000 to $20,000 for recruitment, training and ongoing support of each participant, she said. Mr. Levy has said he intends to hire up to 3,000 aspiring or unlicensed teachers into the program for the 2001-02 school year, an expansion that would cost more than $45 million for that year alone.\n''When we talk about a partnership, we really mean it in the more direct sense of the word -- a full, intensive relationship between a school and a company,'' Ms. Plesser said. While the Board of Education certainly will not turn away any one-time donations of money or equipment or materials, she said, ''that's not the kind of hot, active partnership we really want to encourage.''\nPartnerships between schools and corporations are not new. But in New York City and across the country, such partnerships have varied widely in their inventiveness and success.\nIn New York City, eight chancellors over the last two decades have spoken about or started new efforts to get corporations involved in the schools. Some companies have consistently participated for years. For example, Brooklyn Union Gas began donating gas ranges for use in home economics classes more than 30 years ago. Known today as KeySpan Energy, the company still participates in an array of activities, including letting students shadow its employees through a workday and participating in Junior Achievement programs, which provide students with practical economic and business experiences.\nNationally, adopt-a-school programs became popular in the early 1980's, after the 1981 establishment by the Chicago Board of Education of what might have been the first formal program in the the country. Adopt-a-school programs multiplied particularly rapidly after the publication in 1983 of ''A Nation at Risk,'' the national study documenting the ills of public education.\nMany of those efforts ultimately aim to team a corporation or local organization with a specific school, getting employees to donate their time as well as corporate resources to improve students' experiences. But often those programs, which in theory provide companies with more skilled employees and a better local economy, have been of more benefit to a corporation's public image than to students or their schools. Often, a particular company's involvement frequently lasted little longer than the tenure of the current chief executive or schools chancellor.\nThe establishment this fall of the office of corporate partnerships is in part an attempt to institutionalize what has been a sort of seat-of-the-pants effort.\n''There's been no central mechanism for the schools to report exactly what partnerships they have,'' Ms. Plesser said.\nShe arrived two months ago from the Securities Industry Association, where as associate general counsel she oversaw a program to promote diversity on Wall Street -- itself a challenge of significant proportions. It was also where she got to know Mr. Levy, who worked for Citigroup as a senior executive for compliance. Since starting her new job, Ms. Plesser's office has documented more than 200 direct partnerships between private-sector organizations and individual schools or the Board of Education.\nThey range in scale from a Queens bagel store that provides refreshments for school parent-faculty meetings to companies like Chase Manhattan Bank, Prudential and Salomon Smith Barney, which provide computer equipment, mentoring programs and money for individual schools, districts and the system as a whole.\nStill, that means that only one of every six New York City schools benefits from a corporate partnership. There is almost no way to quantify the dollar value of those efforts, because so much of what is given is individuals' time, and access to workplaces and ideas.\nNor do the estimates include the efforts of nonprofit organizations such as Pencil, Junior Achievement of New York, New York Cares, and the New York City Partnership, each of which has its own programs to support schools, their students and staff.\nWith little coordination among those agencies, there appears to be a lot of overlap, Ms. Plesser said. Many of the schools she identified as having corporate partnerships through the Board of Education also have programs with the nonprofit organizations, leading her to believe that a relative handful of schools enjoy the benefits. Not surprisingly, those that do tend to be located in Manhattan or to serve students that are relatively better off than the average New York City public school student.\nHer office has assumed oversight of the former office of development, which manages the Fund for Public Schools, a sort of endowment and disbursement fund for private-sector donations to the school system, and of the New York City Mentoring Program, which administers programs involving 56 business partners in 50 city high schools.\nThe idea of a growing Board of Education bureaucracy overseeing their efforts has made the leaders of some nonprofit agencies a bit nervous, although they are hesitant to admit it publicly because they want Mr. Levy's support of their continuing efforts.\nAnd despite any such misgivings, most nonprofits welcome Mr. Levy's interest. ''It can only help to enhance the level of involvement of corporations in our schools,'' said Stefan Pryor, vice president for education at the New York City Partnership, an umbrella organization of 300 city business and civic organizations. ''In the past, companies have found it difficult to navigate the labyrinthian system of the Board of Education.''\nRuth Cohen, president of Pencil, which organizes the Principal for a Day program and has matched corporate partners with 300 city schools, said that the nonprofit agenices continue to have a role to play. Organizations like hers have more experience putting corporations together with schools than the central Board of Education does, she said.\n''This is not easy,'' she said of linking corporations and schools. ''It's not something that most businesses are set up for.''\nMs. Plesser said she agreed that nonprofits would remain an important part of the process. ''Those groups do wonderful, wonderful things,'' she said. ''But I don't think they necessarily have the ambitious goals and hopes that the chancellor has for this office.''"},

{"headline": null, "content": "The Dutch Parliament voted today to allow doctors to help end the lives of seriously ill patients who have asked to die. The bill, which is expected to become law next year, would make the Netherlands the first country to legalize mercy killing and doctor-assisted suicide, practices that are already in wide use, though technically a crime.\nThe lower house approved the bill 104-40; endorsement by the Senate is virtually assured.\nThe action was immediately criticized by the Vatican. ''It is a very sad record for the Netherlands to become first to want to approve a law that goes against human dignity,'' said the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. The law will pose a ''very serious question of conscience, which doctors will have to face.''\nBut years of intense debate and opinion polls have shown wide support among the Dutch public and the medical profession for the bill, which aims to clarify and define a practice that is already widely accepted. Dutch doctors have helped thousands of terminally ill people die during the last decade, usually by supplying or administering lethal doses of barbituates.\n''Doctors and healers everywhere have helped people put an end to their suffering and helped them die,'' said Rob Jonquiere, director of the Netherlands Association for Voluntary Euthanasia, which says it has more than 100,000 members. ''This will end a gray area. We don't want something of this importance to go on underground.''\nThe new legislation, which was introduced by the ministers of justice and of health, applies only to physicians and not to others who might help a person die or commit suicide.\nIt incorporates guidelines drawn up in recent years by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. They stipulate that a patient's request to die must be voluntary and persistent, and made while the person is lucid. The physician must be convinced that the patient is facing interminable and unbearable suffering. The doctor may not suggest death as an option. In all cases, physicians must seek a second medical opinion before helping a patient to die, and they must report the cause of death as euthanasia or suicide.\nPhysicians will remain accountable for their actions. What is new, as euthanasia is decriminalized, is that physicians will not be accountable to a prosecutor but to a panel of peers, including legal, medical and ethical experts.\nUnder the new legislation, no one has a right to euthanasia. Every doctor has a right to refuse to cooperate if a patient asks for help to die.\nOne clause in an earlier draft of the legislation that would have permitted terminally ill children 12 or older to choose to die was dropped after it caused a public outcry. As passed today, the law would require young people from 12 to 16 to have parental consent. From age 16, they may put the question to their doctor without their parents' approval.\nThe measure is likely to draw particular scrutiny in other countries wrestling with the questions of doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia.\nIn Belgium, France and Switzerland, the issue has been under intense debate among legislators and in the news media. In 1996 the Northern Territory in Australia approved, but later revoked, a law allowing medically assisted suicide. In the United States, Oregon permits doctors in certain cases to help patients end their own lives.\nIn the Netherlands, there have been calls for regulating euthanasia for three decades. These demands increased in 1973, when a doctor brought on the death of her aged, dying mother and was punished -- symbolically -- with a one-year suspended sentence.\nSince then, few doctors have been been prosecuted. But studies suggest that only half or fewer of the incidents of euthanasia or assisted suicide are reported, implying that doctors misrepresent the actual cause of death.\nAccording to preliminary figures, a reported 2,216 patients were assisted by doctors last year in bringing about death, but the actual number is believed to be closer to 5,000. Almost nine out of ten of the reported cases involved people in the terminal stage of cancer.\nAt the same time, doctors continue to refuse many requests, either because they are opposed in principle or because they feel the request is not justified. According to national surveys, about two of three people who ask doctors to bring on their deaths are refused.\nAlthough the Netherlands is unusually open to social experiments, the complex moral, ethical and legal issues involved in ending a life keep resurfacing. Polls show that 10 percent of the population, and 10 percent of physicians, are adamantly opposed to the law.\nEven those who support the principle of euthanasia or assisted suicide are deeply divided, with some arguing that the law is too restrictive and should allow terminally ill patients to receive life-ending drugs without a doctor's approval.\nThe new bill did not clearly address the question of patients with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The current practice is that doctors seek written confirmation of a patient's wish to die. But the question remains what to do when a patient who has written the request while sound of mind is later found to be suffering from dementia.\nThe Health Ministry said dementia itself can never be a valid reason for ending a person's life. The patient would have to be suffering from intolerable physical pain, it said, and the dementia could only be at a very early stage for a patient's request for euthanasia or assisted suicide to be accepted. --------------------\nBy The Associated Press\nA bill passed by the lower house of the Dutch Parliament set the following guidelines for carrying out euthanasia or assisted suicide:\n*The physician must be convinced that the patient's request is voluntary and well considered.\n*The physician must be convinced that the patient is facing unremitting and unbearable suffering. The patient does not have to be terminally ill.\n*The patient must have a correct and clear understanding of his or her situation and prognosis.\n*The physician, together with the patient, must reach the conclusion that there is no reasonable alternative that is acceptable to the patient. The decision to die must be the patient's own.\n*The physician must consult at least one other independent doctor who has examined the patient.\n*The physician must end the patient's life in a medically appropriate manner."},

''For example,'' it said, Francis Sweeney was an assistant prosecutor in Dr. Sheppard's second trial and is now a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court who declined to recuse himself in the action last April.\nThe phrase ''for example'' was juxtaposed with Justice Sweeney's background during the editing process. And the account of Justice Sweeney's history was erroneous. While he indeed worked in the county prosecutor's office in 1966, he did not participate in the Sheppard case. (The error also occurred in two 1998 articles and an editorial that year.) The Times learned of the error last month when Justice Sweeney filed a defamation lawsuit over it."},

It also has, however, been widely criticized by industry analysts for inefficiency, corruption in its highest ranks and operating more like a government bureaucracy than a business.\nPemex is the world's largest oil company in terms of employees, with about 130,000, but ranks only fourth in terms of production, said David Shields, an oil industry analyst in Mexico City.\nMr. Fox has emphasized the need to court foreign investment to modernize Pemex and meet the nation's energy demands. But he also promised not to privatize the company, a move that could have been politically unpopular.\nMr. Munoz will have to modernize the company's infrastructure without the immediate benefit of proposed changes in Mexico's Constitution that would permit the partial privatization of Pemex.\nHe said in his acceptance speech Monday night that he would work to invest a larger percentage of the company's revenue in infrastructure modernization. Today, almost all of the company's profits are channeled to the government."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Publicly and privately, a surprisingly large number of actors, directors, studio and television executives and talent agents have battled and are still battling drug and alcohol addiction. But few celebrities have so publicly suffered the torments and humiliation of addiction as Robert Downey Jr.\nOne of Hollywood's more talented actors, Mr. Downey, 35, was arrested on Saturday night in a luxury villa at a Palm Springs, Calif., resort on charges of possessing cocaine and methamphetamine and committing a felony while out on bail. For Mr. Downey, whose life in the last few years has been a swirl of drug arrests and imprisonment, the latest episode, which may send him back to prison, was especially sad to his friends and associates.\nHis career had been rapidly reviving since his release from prison three and a half months ago. He had a recurring role on ''Ally McBeal'' as Calista Flockhart's love interest. He was set to star in a new movie, ''America's Sweethearts,'' with Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Billy Crystal. And he was scheduled to play ''Hamlet'' next year in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson. Now his future is at best uncertain.\n''Those of us who love Robert -- and there are many of us -- are heartbroken,'' said Ed Limato, co-president and vice chairman of International Creative Management and Mr. Downey's agent.\nSurprisingly, Mr. Downey was back at work today on the set of ''Ally McBeal'' in Manhattan Beach, south of Los Angeles, said his spokesman, Alan Nierob. ''He was studying his lines yesterday to get back to work today,'' he said.\nBut Mr. Downey's return to work may be short lived.\nJoe Roth, the former chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, who is directing ''America's Sweethearts,'' and whose company, Revolution Studios, is making the film, which starts shooting on Jan. 11, said Mr. Downey's role in the film was now uncertain. ''I don't know what's going to happen,'' he said. ''It's heartbreaking that this happened. We're trying to sort it out now. We don't want to hurt him in any way, but we have to figure out what we'll do for our movie.'' Complicating the issue, Mr. Downey, who was released early Sunday on $15,000 bail, is to appear in court on Dec. 27, two weeks before filming.\nBeyond this, lawyers and studio executives said, Mr. Downey's job prospects may be especially damaged by the possible reluctance of insurance companies to underwrite films featuring him because of his addiction and the possibility of future arrest.\nMr. Downey was seized on Saturday night in a $600-a-night room at Merv Griffin's Resort Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs. Apparently he had spent Thanksgiving alone at the hotel. In a tape released by the Palm Springs police, an anonymous caller said, ''Uh, yeah, I'd just like to let you know that in Room 311 of the Merv Griffin Resort there is a man that is doing an ounce of cocaine and a couple of guns and is pretty upset. Thank you.'' The police said the call came from a phone booth in nearby Cathedral City.\nThe police said that Mr. Downey gave them no trouble when they arrived about 9 p.m. ''He was cooperative and, in our opinion, under the influence of a controlled substance,'' said Sgt. Patrick Williams, a spokesman for the Palm Springs police. ''He was charged with that. He invited the officers into the suite, and we continued the seach. Throughout the entire incident he was compliant.''\nDrugs were found in the room, the police said, but no weapons. He was released on bail about 6 a.m. on Sunday. Mr. Downey is separated from his wife, Deborah Falconer, a former model and musician. They have a 7-year-old son, Indio.\nHeidi Geier, general manager of the 100-suite hotel, said Mr. Downey had checked in on Wednesday night and was set to leave on Sunday. ''I greeted him when he arrived,'' she said. ''He was friendly, very nice. He kept very private. He behaved normally -- no ruckus, no parties, no noise.''\nMs. Geier said she saw Mr. Downey as he was led away. ''He seemed very sad, very, very subdued,'' she said. ''I heard him say that he needed to get to work on Monday.''\nIn the last decade Mr. Downey's soaring acting career, marked by films like ''Less Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born Killers,'' ''Wonder Boys,'' ''Two Girls and a Guy'' and ''One Night Stand,'' has also been marred by repeated arrests.\nIn June 1996 he was stopped by the police in Malibu for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway. Searching his pickup truck, the police found heroin, cocaine and an unloaded .357 magnum. The next month, while awaiting trial, he was found unconscious in a bed of a neighbor's house, under the influence of drugs. He was arrested again. A judge ordered him into a rehabilitation program.\nMr. Downey was placed on probation. But after two violations and his acknowledgment that he was still an addict, he was sentenced to Corcoran State Prison for three years. After one year he was released on $5,000 bail after the California Second District Court of Appeals ruled that he had served enough time to fulfill his three-year sentence. Essentially he was given credit for serving in drug treatment.\nAfter his release, Mr. Downey vowed to stop taking drugs. ''I've created zero wreckage today,'' he told a magazine reporter last month. ''And I intend to create no more.''\nHollywood is, in many ways, a place that forgives almost anything but failure. Stars like Eddie Murphy and Hugh Grant have been picked up by the police after episodes with prostitutes, but their careers hardly faded. The actor Christian Slater spent 90 days in jail two years ago for a drug-related battery conviction, but his career was not destroyed. In some ways, by Hollywood terms, Mr. Downey may be unemployable not because of his addiction but because he faces jail time.\nHe has long acknowledged the power of his drug addiction. ''It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, with my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal,'' he told a judge in 1999.\nA psychiatrist, Manijeh Mikakhtar, who visited Mr. Downey during his prison stay, testified that the actor was suffering from bipolar disorder, or manic depression, and that his drug use was ''self-medicating.''\nTo his colleagues as well as executives, Mr. Downey not only has a reputation as a highly skilled actor -- he was nominated for an Academy Award for the 1992 film ''Chaplin'' -- but also as a gentle if fun-loving figure.\n''There was more good will for Robert than you can imagine when he came out of prison,'' said a friend who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Everyone was rooting for him. He's a nice person.''\nMr. Downey's has not made his whereabouts in Los Angeles known, but one friend said that since his release from state prison he had been working with a sponsor from Walden House, a nonprofit rehabilitation program in downtown Los Angeles. The friend said that Mr. Downey lived with someone from Walden House for a while. More recently Mr. Downey was living on his own but was constantly in touch with the treatment center, the friend said.\nMr. Downey has completed eight episodes of ''Ally McBeal.'' The fourth was shown on Monday night. He recently agreed to appear in two more episodes. Chris Alexander, manager of media relations for 20th Century Fox Television, which produces ''Ally McBeal,'' said that Mr. Downey was expected to complete the two final episodes shortly.\nSome of Mr. Downey's friends said that his addiction is particularly virulent. ''His addiction is chemical, it's biological,'' said James Toback, the writer and director and a friend who worked with the actor on three films. ''I don't even think even he knows what's going to happen now.''\nWhat makes Mr. Downey's fall especially sad was that his addiction probably began as a child in Greenwich Village when he was given drugs by his father, Robert Downey Sr., the independent filmmaker. ''I think that a lot of us did things and thought it would be hypocritical to not have our kids participate in marijuana and stuff like that,'' the elder Mr. Downey said in a documentary by his son about the 1992 Presidential campaign, ''The Last Party.'' ''So we thought it was cute to let them smoke it. And all that was an idiot move on our parts to share that with our children.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "He never directly asked for the nation's patience. Today, three weeks after the most inconclusive presidential election in modern times, he took note of it, saying, ''The American people have shown great patience in these extraordinary days,'' but he did not actually ask for it.\nStill, that is precisely what Vice President Al Gore is seeking as he soldiers on with his uphill legal battle in Florida and sets in motion a full-fledged public-relations campaign, starring himself, on the nation's airwaves in an effort to keep his supporters from losing heart.\nMr. Gore stepped before the cameras this afternoon for the second time in 17 hours. His top advisers briefed the nation's Democratic governors today. Tonight the vice president taped a lengthy segment to be broadcast Wednesday morning on NBC's ''Today,'' and aides said he was planning more interviews.\nIn addition, Mr. Gore invited Lawrence H. Summers, the secretary of the treasury, to lunch at his residence here -- and invited the cameras in for a brief snapshot. While Mr. Gore told reporters later that the two mostly discussed the economy, the pictures telegraphed the important signal that Mr. Gore is moving ahead with transition plans; that is, Gov. George W. Bush is not the only one planning to be president.\nMr. Summers is a likely choice to stay on in a Gore cabinet, and his presence at Mr. Gore's table today was designed to convey a sense of continuity of the economy, a major theme of Mr. Gore's presidential campaign, as well as a continuity of power, despite the weeks of legal wrangling over the vote.\n''We cannot jeopardize an orderly transition of power to the next administration, nor need we do so,'' Mr. Gore said. He said later, ''I don't think it's right for me to be offering people jobs,'' but left little doubt that he wanted to show that he had a firm handle on the economy's throttle.\n''Most of what Secretary Summers and I talked about had to do with economic policy, with the state of the U.S. economy, what is likely to happen in the months and years ahead here and in other parts of the world,'' he said, calling Mr. Summers ''a close friend and close adviser.''\nDuring a short meeting with reporters outside his house, Mr. Gore sought to convey greater urgency and tried to cast his battle as an unselfish struggle to defend democracy. With the National Cathedral soaring in the background, Mr. Gore persisted in pressing some of the same themes he had raised in his speech the night before.\n''As I said last evening, this is America,'' Mr. Gore said. ''When people vote, their votes are counted.''\nHe persevered in his notion that thousands of ballots have not been counted. In fact, many ballots have not been recounted by hand, which is what he is seeking, though most have been counted or examined and rejected by counting machines.\nAs to fairness, Mr. Gore was asked how it was fair to ask for a recount of votes in Democratic areas in Florida but not in Republican areas.\nMr. Gore said he had proposed a hand recount of the entire state, but acknowledged that ''it's less of a realistic possibility now.'' He also discussed the ''old, cheap'' voting machines in low-income areas of the state, a discussion that, along with his handling of the legal issues, showed that he is immersed in the dispute in a way that Mr. Bush is not.\nMr. Gore's new public-relations strategy and more frequent statements are intended to buttress his sympathy with weary voters, but may also carry risks. Several Republican strategists noted that they were happy to see Mr. Gore taking center stage because they believe he loses support with every performance.\nOf his court action, Mr. Gore said today that his goal was simple: ''To ensure a complete count of all the votes cast in Florida.'' But he also needs to keep public opinion, which is starting to build against him, from eroding completely. And so he portrayed himself as the one who is trying to be ''expeditious'' while Governor Bush, he says, is the one who is dragging things out.\n''I believe this is a time to count every vote, and not to run out the clock,'' Mr. Gore said. ''This is not a time for delay, obstruction and procedural roadblocks.''\nThis is just what the Republicans have accused Mr. Gore of. And today they said that he had failed in his address Monday to make his case. Further, they said, he was not stating the truth in his assertion that the ballots had not been counted.\n''We had a count of all the votes in Florida, and then a complete recount of all those votes and then a selective manual recount of some of those votes,'' Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, told reporters in Texas. ''Now, having come up short in all those counts and all those times, Vice President Gore is proposing to make up yet another set of rules.''\nToday, Mr. Gore wanted to convey that he had proposed a timetable for ending the legal challenges in Florida, and while he portrayed his plan as far speedier than Mr. Bush's, it could work out to be quite similar.\n''We have proposed to the court in Tallahassee a plan to have all the ballots counted in seven days, starting tomorrow morning, and to have the court proceedings fully completed one or two days after that,'' Mr. Gore said.\n''Unfortunately, just about an hour ago, Governor Bush's lawyers rejected this proposal,'' he added. ''Instead, they have proposed two weeks of additional court proceedings and additional hearings, right up to the Dec. 12 deadline for seating electors. And under their plan, none of the thousands of votes that remain to be counted would be counted at all.''\nMr. Gore's lawyers went to court today in Florida seeking a recount of about 13,000 ballots in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties.\nMr. Gore's advisers said that Mr. Gore wanted to show that he had a plan for ending the counting, that he would not battle on forever and that he was not so steeped in the recount that he could not focus on other matters."},
{"headline": null, "content": "A development group signed a contract yesterday to pay up to $680 million for the largest tract of undeveloped land remaining in Manhattan: 9.2 acres of waterfront property south of the United Nations, intended for a residential and commercial complex of more than five million square feet.\nThe group, led by the Fisher real estate family, is buying the land, along First Avenue between 35th and 41st Streets, from Consolidated Edison. The size and location of the project, which would include green space and a waterfront esplanade, could be described as a developer's dream.\nBut it may be a dream deferred.\nCon Edison has to gain regulatory approval to close and demolish a 99-year-old electric and steam generating station on the site, and the developer needs to wade through the city's often tortuous public review process, which could take four years. Three community coalitions have already lined up against the proposal.\nThe Fishers, nevertheless, vanquished a dozen competing developers to lock up what has become one of the rarest of all commodities in Manhattan -- a large development site with waterfront views.\n''It's a great site because of its sheer size and its location on the river, near the U.N.,'' said Robert E. Selsam, senior vice president of Boston Properties, an unsuccessful bidder. ''But it'll be years before we see anything happen there.''\nJoan S. Freilich, chief financial officer of Con Edison, said it was a great deal for both the city and the company's ratepayers. The Public Service Commission has specified that Con Edison's customers must benefit from the proceeds of the sale.\nThe tract comprises four different parcels, all along First Avenue. There are two lots now used primarily for parking, while another has a small office building. Con Ed plans to transfer those parcels to the developer within two years and both sides have hired the TRC Companies to begin a $103.5 million environmental cleanup of the land.\nThe Waterside steam plant sits on the largest parcel, along First Avenue between 38th and 40th Streets. Before the plant can be demolished, Con Edison must first win the Public Service Commission's approval and expand the generating capacity of its power plant on East 14th Street. Con Edison officials said yesterday that they expected to complete the expansion by the end of 2002.\n''It's the last major Midtown site and it's perfectly located,'' said Richard L. Fisher, senior partner at the family's company, Fisher Brothers. ''We're in the early stages of organizing a design competition for what we think will be a landmark development.''\nMr. Fisher said he and his partners, Sheldon H. Solow, another developer, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, had retained Bill Lacy, president of Purchase College of the State University of New York and executive director of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, to solicit proposals from architects and urban planners.\nTwo executives working with Fisher Brothers said that the developer would also reach out to community groups to address their concerns.\nBut those executives also said that litigation by community groups could slow the process down. Development in New York, particularly on such a large, complicated tract, could take a long time.\nEdan Unterman, the president of the East Midtown Coalition for Sensible Development and a member of the local community board, said he was concerned about the size and scale of the project the Fishers intend to build. His group, which favors a master plan for all nine acres, is concerned about increased traffic, access to the waterfront and the need for parkland in the neighborhood.\n''We do not believe that there is a major city in the world that would allow such an enormous and highly visible project to go forward without public discussion,'' Mr. Unterman said. ''It's being steamrolled by the P.S.C.''\nIt is unclear exactly what the developer can build on the land, in part because the industrial property has to be rezoned for residential and commercial development, a process that requires city approval. During informal discussions with the developer over the last year, Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the Planning Department, said he would like to see a design that includes an esplanade, green space and buildings no taller than 45 or 50 stories.\nThe purchase price -- $576 million to $680 million -- would fall drastically if Con Edison were unable to gain approval to expand its 14th Street power plant and demolish the Waterside station.\nSeveral community groups have already voiced their opposition to the expansion, warning of an increased level of toxic emissions.\n''They thought they could just come in and push it through,'' said Susan Stetzer, vice president of the East River Environmental Coalition, who lives near the 14th Street power plant. ''This community is not going to allow that.''"},

A Leon County judge will hear a lawsuit by a Democrat who says that about 15,000 absentee ballots in Seminole County should be voided because elections officials improperly let Republicans correct registration information on many of them.

{"headline": null, "content": "Here are the main events that occurred yesterday in the battle for the presidency.\nIn Vice President Al Gore's race against time to have a Florida state court overturn Gov. George W. Bush's narrow victory, a judge rejected his request for an immediate hand recount of disputed votes from Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties. But the judge, N. Sanders Sauls, did order the counties to send the nearly 14,000 disputed ballots to his court, along with some voting machines by Friday so he could begin hearing arguments on Saturday.\nMr. Gore, who is facing a Dec. 12 federal deadline for selecting Florida's 25 electors, was hoping that counting could begin on Wednesday to leave time for an appeal to the State Supreme Court.\nHoping to settle the election in the the Republican-dominated legislature rather than in a courtroom, Florida legislators hired lawyers who told a special committee that that body was obligated to appoint Florida's electors itself. The lawyers said the legislature had to step in and pick the electors when the outcome of an election is in doubt.\nMr. Bush's lawyers pressed his case before the United States Supreme Court, arguing that none of the recounts should be or should have been allowed, in part in an effort to doom Mr. Gore's new lawsuit now pending in state court.\nMr. Gore made his second national television appearance in as many days in his campaign to drum up support for his continued legal fight. He also plans to appear on the ''Today Show'' and several other programs today.\nWhile it continues to deny the Bush team access to the official transition office, the White House began treating both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore as unofficial presidents-elect, offering to meet with both teams' transition directors and agreeing to provide its daily intelligence briefings to both sides.\nFour days after being discharged from the hospital after a mild heart attack, Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, has taken over the task of setting up an administration that is not quite official yet."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The principal of a Queens elementary school where four children were molested last week has been reassigned to a district office while officials investigate the attacks, Board of Education officials said yesterday.\nCleonice LoSecco, 74, the principal of Public School 89 in Elmhurst since 1974, was transferred Monday to the District 24 office, where she will do administrative work, officials said.\nSince Nov. 20, when the four children were molested by a man lurking in a stairwell, hundreds of parents have gathered each morning outside the school, many wearing yellow ribbons, to show their anger and concern about security at P.S. 89. Police are still searching for the assailant.\nBoard of Education officials have described Ms. LoSecco's record until now as unblemished. Bruce Bryant, a lawyer for the principals' union, which represents Ms. LoSecco, said it was routine practice for a principal to be temporarily reassigned during an investigation. ''At the end of the investigation, she should be returning,'' he said, unless charges of misconduct are brought against her.\nFior Rodriguez, the mother of a third-grade boy at P.S. 89, and the organizer of several parent demonstrations, said most parents were relieved to see the principal reassigned.\nMs. Rodriguez said that she and other parents had been happy with Ms. LoSecco's leadership on academic matters. ''The school is very strict, very demanding academic-wise,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''The teachers are great.''\nBut parents were concerned that Ms. LoSecco might have brushed off a similar incident the week before the attacks on the four children, Ms. Rodriguez said. In that incident, a girl was approached by a stranger in the building, but ran away before anything happened. Parents say that Ms. LoSecco failed to report the incident to the police.\nSchool officials have said that they cannot confirm the previous incident, but that they are looking into it as part of their investigation.\nMs. LoSecco was reassigned by the district superintendent, Joseph Quinn, who replaced her temporarily with Casper Cacioppo, an administrator from another school, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education.\n''We're very happy the principal was removed,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, a constituent caseworker in the office of United States Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Queens Democrat. ''We're keeping a vigil as a sign of solidarity to show that we're still here and make sure that the demands are met and kept as promised.''\nAt a meeting last Wednesday, school officials promised to permanently increase the number of school safety officers to two, from one, at P.S. 89, which has 1,800 students, and to add four more officers, including a supervisor, for the remainder of this school year."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The White House began treating both George W. Bush and Al Gore as unofficial presidents-elect today, saying it had offered to meet with both candidates' transition directors and had arranged to provide Governor Bush the same daily intelligence briefings that Mr. Gore receives as vice president.\nThe White House also sought a legal opinion from the Justice Department on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation might begin background checks on prospective cabinet nominees of both candidates, although aides to President Clinton said there would surely remain plenty of preliminary work for each side to do before the F.B.I. could begin any such reviews.\nThe new moves seemed to soften a stance the White House had taken only Monday, when administration officials, in refusing a request from the Bush campaign for federal transition funds and office space, pointedly declared that the governor was not yet president-elect. Still, with court cases continuing, the administration sought to walk a careful line today, avoiding any steps that would reinforce Mr. Bush's contention that he has in fact won the election.\nThe Bush campaign responded to the White House offer of a transition meeting by accepting, although a time has yet to be arranged.\nThe offer came from Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, John D. Podesta, who said in an interview: ''We're trying to ensure that we have a professional, efficient transition no matter who takes over. There's certain things we can do now. There's other things we can do later.''\nBut in another interview, on the CBS News television program ''The Early Show,'' Mr. Podesta responded curtly to a suggestion on Monday by Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate, that the White House ought to begin treating the governor as the official president-elect.\n''Vice President-elect -- as he likes to be called -- Cheney better go back and actually look at the statute,'' Mr. Podesta said of the presidential-transitions law, which requires that there be a clear election winner before the government frees federal assistance to an incoming administration.\nAs a result, access to the official government transition offices and the pot of money to cover transition costs remained barred to both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore today, and agencies across the federal government waited for a definitive end to the election before extending assistance to either.\nFor instance, while the transitions law gives an incoming administration free mailing privileges similar to those enjoyed by members of Congress, the Postal Service said it would not yet provide any to either nominee. (Since the vice president and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, already have such privileges, the issue is of note only to the Bush side.)\nThe Secret Service, for its part, said it would continue protecting both presidential candidates, both vice-presidential candidates and their spouses until well after the election is settled. If Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney lose the election, they will, as is customary, lose their Secret Service protection only eventually rather than immediately, a spokesman for the agency said. In the event of a Democratic loss, Mr. Gore would keep the protection he receives as vice president, and Mr. Lieberman would revert to the protection he and other senators receive from the Capitol police, the spokesman said.\nMr. Podesta spoke by telephone late Monday with Andrew H. Card Jr., Governor Bush's choice as White House chief of staff, and offered to meet with Mr. Card to discuss transition issues. But Mr. Podesta also called Roy Neel, who is in charge of Mr. Gore's transition, to offer a similar meeting. ''I had virtually duplicate conversations with Card and Roy Neel,'' Mr. Podesta said.\nMr. Podesta also offered the Bush team regular intelligence briefings, a suggestion that he said had come from the Gore camp. Later, Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser, called his counterpart in the Bush campaign, Condoleezza Rice, to arrange the briefings, which will be extended to the governor and his national security aides.\nMr. Bush received a general intelligence briefing in Texas from several senior officials of the Central Intelligence Agency after he became the Republican presidential nominee. And Mr. Berger has provided regular updates to Ms. Rice on world events in the months since, aides said. But the new briefings, to be conducted by the C.I.A., will be more comprehensive and more regular, aides said, and will be in keeping with a practice extended for the benefit of presidents-elect as far back as the Truman administration.\n''We will send a senior analyst to Texas or wherever to do the briefings,'' an intelligence official said. ''They are typically six days a week -- not on Sundays, unless world events dictate.''\nMs. Rice said in an interview from her California office this evening that under the arrangements worked out with Mr. Berger, Governor Bush would receive the same daily intelligence briefing that Vice President Gore receives."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The United States government now spends less than a quarter of what it spent in 1993 to spread American culture abroad. Gone are government-sponsored performances by symphony orchestras and by giant opera companies that once entranced audiences abroad.\n''People think that we are movies, hamburgers and other cliches,'' Evelyn S. Lieberman, a State Department official, said recently, lamenting the decline and speaking in anticipation of a conference today at the White House on culture and diplomacy.\nMs. Lieberman, who is the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, said she hoped the White House conference would give impetus to the establishment of an endowment in the State Department made up of private donations to make up for the money that Congress has declined to approve.\nBills to establish such an endowment were introduced in Congress this year by Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. The Leach and Biden bills were introduced too late in the Congressional year for any votes or hearings.\nPresident Clinton said at the conference that he supported the Leach-Biden approach to an endowment.\nPresenting American arts through embassies, he said, ''will become more and more important.''\nMr. Clinton, who presided over a panel discussion in the East Room, cited examples of the nation's culture serving positive ends, from the Glenn Miller Orchestra and others sustaining Allied morale during World War II, to a poster in Poland that depicted his favorite movie, ''High Noon,'' in which Gary Cooper's sheriff's badge had been supplanted by a Solidarity pin, to the use of Superman comic books to teach Bosnian children to avoid land mines.\nIn response to Mr. Clinton's observation that American popular culture was known throughout the world, another panelist, Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who was the Nobel laureate in literature in 1986, suggested that the United States was itself too insular.\n''Yes,'' Mr. Clinton replied. ''It's a two-way street.''\nSecretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, seated next to Mr. Clinton, said that ''our cultural diplomacy programs are central'' to American foreign policy and she called for financing them ''more generously.''\nHillary Rodham Clinton made a brief appearance at the session and said that ''the arts foster a civil society'' even when ''the dialogue of diplomacy is strained.''\nAs Mrs. Clinton turned to leave the room, Mr. Clinton explained why she was not staying. ''Hillary got a culturally excused absence,'' he said. ''She's going to sign copies of her new book.''\nIf a measure to set up a cultural endowment that Mr. Clinton favors is ever approved, it will come after Ms. Lieberman, a Clinton appointee, is gone.\nAsked how the proposal for an endowment could get past the opposition of lawmakers like Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has led the opposition to the existing national endowments for the arts and humanities, Ms. Lieberman smiled and said, ''He doesn't have to pay for it.''\nAs sketched out by Ms. Lieberman and her senior adviser, Bill Barrett, the proposed endowment would receive tax-deductible donations from individuals and corporations and use the money to send American arts groups abroad.\n''Everything that we do is a reflection of our vast, diverse culture -- quilts, dancers, jazz, all of our arts traditions,'' Ms. Lieberman said. ''We have unbelievable things to say that are not just violence in the movies.''\nThe endowment, Ms. Lieberman said, would be independent of the government and would make the decisions on what or who to send.\nRick Ruth, Ms. Lieberman's chief of staff, said: ''First there was a slow and then a precipitous decline in money for cultural and artistic programming. The thing that is often lost in these discussions is that we conduct all of these programs for the good of the U.S. government.''\nStatistics provided by Ms. Lieberman's office show that in constant dollars education and cultural spending by the United States abroad has declined by 72 percent since 1990, to $1.8 million today from the equivalent of $6.4 million in 1990. The high-water mark of such spending abroad was the $8.05 million spent in 1993.\n''Among the things that an ambassador can get out of cultural programming are access to groups not easy to reach by other means, people who don't want to engage in a political discussion with the United States,'' Mr. Ruth said. ''But they will turn out to a cultural performance -- a single piano player, a jazz quartet or a choral performance of 'Porgy and Bess,' which was done recently in Cairo.\n''There was a time when the United States would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to send, for example, the New York Philharmonic or the Martha Graham Dance Company. Foreign governments really turned out for these things and looked on them with great favor, and it spoke to our values.''\nMr. Ruth said the State Department still had limited funds to send performers abroad, but added, ''A jazz quartet would be about the largest we could do.''\nOne large performing arts group, Dance Theater of Harlem, performed in Beijing and Shanghai this month, but Mr. Ruth said that was largely because the dance company had raised most of the estimated $500,000 for the tour from its own benefactors, with the State Department providing only $80,000.\nMs. Lieberman said the Chinese government had asked why the United States was sending a black troupe.\n''Because they are terrific dancers and represent the diversity of America,'' Ms. Lieberman said she answered."},
{"headline": null, "content": "When Florida's votes were counted on Election Day, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had a tiny but possibly decisive edge: the majority of the state's black voters, Vice President Al Gore's most reliable voters, stalwart supporters, cast their ballots on punch cards that are more prone to voter error and miscounts.\nAcross the state, nearly 4 percent of the type of punch-card ballots most widely used in Florida were thrown out because the machines read them as blank or invalid. By contrast, the more modern, optical scanning systems rejected far fewer votes -- only about 1.4 percent of those cast.\nA New York Times analysis shows that 64 percent of the state's black voters live in counties that used the punch cards while 56 percent of whites did so. While black voters made up 16 percent of the vote on Election Day, that small difference, the analysis suggests, could have had a decisive effect on an election decided by only a few hundred votes out of nearly six million. Exit polls show that blacks voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore.\nVice President Al Gore raised the issue of the disproportionate effect of the punch-card ballot yesterday as he defended the Democrats' demands for recounts in three counties that used them. ''The old and cheap, outdated machinery is usually found in areas with populations that are of lower income, minorities, seniors on fixed incomes,'' Mr. Gore said.\nIn Florida, county officials determined in each county what kinds of machines to use for voting. In some of the counties where punch cards are used, the officials are Republicans; in others, they are Democrats.\nWhile Mr. Gore was citing the differences in voting systems as part of his argument for a recount, Allan J. Lichtman, chairman of the Department of History at American University in Washington, who has testified in dozens of voting rights lawsuits, said they could violate federal law, even if the variations were not intentional or politically motivated.\n''If minorities have less of an opportunity to participate fully in the process, that's a direct violation of the Voting Rights Act,'' Mr. Lichtman said.\nWhen optical ballot scanners are used, voters mark their choice with a pencil next to the name of their candidate. This appears to make them less susceptible to voter error.\nThe large number of ballots in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties in which the paper punch-card machines detected no choice for president has stirred controversy. Democrats say many of these ballots were failed attempts to cast votes; Republicans say these voters had no preference for either candidate or failed to register their choice correctly.\nA survey of several large Florida counties turned up an anomaly: Floridians whose ballots were read by the machines as not registering a choice for president were much more likely to have voted with computer punch cards.\nIn Orange County, the largest to use the optical equipment, only 1 in 300 ballots was blank in the presidential race. In Manatee and Brevard Counties, the rate approached 1 in 800. Mr. Bush easily carried Manatee and Brevard Counties while Mr. Gore prevailed in Orange.\nThe punch-card-voting counties, by contrast, had sharply higher numbers of people tallied as having no vote for president. In Miami-Dade, the Florida county with the most votes cast, the machines read 1 in 60 ballots as having no vote for president. In Hillsborough, near Tampa, it was 1 in 67. And in Pinellas County, it was 1 of 96.\nMr. Gore won Miami-Dade and Pinellas while Mr. Bush carried Hillsborough.\nThe Times analysis showed that registered Democrats in Florida were only slightly more likely to vote in counties that use punch-card machines than Republicans. But 63 percent of Mr. Gore's votes were counted on the type of punch-card machines at issue in Palm Beach County, compared with 55 percent of Mr. Bush's.\nStatewide, the pattern was reversed on the optical scan systems. Forty percent of the Bush votes were tallied on these systems, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Gore.\nThe impact of these differences on the outcome will never be known but their potential magnitude is evident in Miami-Dade County, where predominantly black precincts saw their votes thrown out at twice the rate as Hispanic precincts and nearly four times the rate of white precincts. In all, 1 out of 11 ballots in predominantly black precincts were rejected, a total of 9,904.\nHad all people cast ballots that could be counted along the same lines as their neighbors, Mr. Gore would have gained nearly 7,000 votes.\nFlorida voters cast their ballots in a patchwork of different voting technologies. Nearly 60 percent of voters cast ballots on the punch ballot system, while more than a third use optical scanning system. Some small counties use paper ballots, or mechanical voting machines.\nEach county makes its own decisions on which type of machine to use, and there have been no indications that the choice of machine is designed to favor any party or candidate.\nChuck Smith, a systems administrator in Hillsborough County, said that the county had long been aware of limitations of the punch ballot system used there and had been working for years on a successor system.\nBut he said that when he headed a study of alternatives for three Florida counties, he found that the optical scanning system was costly to set up, and was prone to other problems. Instead, he said, the county is waiting for the state to approve companies that could supply an electronic voting system.\nHe said companies had been slow to provide the state with software and equipment for testing, but he expected that process to speed up, once the books are finally closed on the presidential election.\n''I think it will move much faster now,'' he said.\nAcross the country, the punch-card systems have resulted in significantly higher numbers of uncounted ballots. In 467 counties that used punch cards with pre-punched cards in the 1996 presidential election, according to a New York Times analysis, 661,000 of the 25 million ballots were not counted, or 2.6 percent of the total.\nIn 729 counties that used optical scanning technology, 1.9 percent of the ballots cast had no votes for president counted, according to the Times analysis of data provided by Election Data Services, a nonpartisan consulting firm in Washington.\nBut in areas where the voting technology prevents voting for more than one person in a race -- on lever machines, for instance -- the percentage of voters who cast no presidential vote was low this year. In Connecticut, only one half of 1 percent of those who went to the polls failed to cast a presidential vote."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush told the United States Supreme Court today that their client has as much, if not more, at stake now in the appeal to be argued on Friday than he did last week when he asked the justices to intervene in the Florida vote-counting dispute.\nBoth sides filed their opening briefs with the court today, with lawyers for Vice President Al Gore contending that the Bush appeal ''rests on intemperate and insupportable mischaracterizations'' of the Florida Supreme Court ruling that Mr. Bush has asked the justices to overturn.\nThe brief the Bush team filed took pains to refute any suggestion that Mr. Bush's certification Sunday night as the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes -- the same certification he would have received had the Florida Supreme Court not ordered a 12-day extension of the statutory deadline for vote-counting -- made his appeal of that court's ruling moot or diminished in importance.\nIf the justices accept Mr. Bush's legal position that the Florida Supreme Court had no authority to extend the deadline or to make any other ''changes'' in Florida election law, then the claims of Mr. Gore's new lawsuit in state court contesting the election results are doomed to failure, the Bush brief argues.\nFor example, the Gore claims that the Miami-Dade County canvassing board should have continued manually recounting votes to the revised Nov. 26 deadline, and that state election officials should have included partial results from the Palm Beach County manual recount in the final totals, ''will be rendered invalid if the state election officials are free to enforce, as the proper deadline under federal law, the statutory deadline previously established by the Florida legislature,'' the brief maintains.\nFurther, if the justices agree with the Bush position that no election-related standard not in place before Election Day could be applied now, then Mr. Gore's challenge to the Palm Beach refusal to count dimpled ballots would also fail, the brief said.\nMr. Gore's legal team did not respond to these assertions in the brief they filed this afternoon, but will undoubtedly do so in the next round of briefs, to be filed on Thursday.\nUnder the accelerated schedule the court ordered when it accepted the Bush appeal on Friday, the two sides filed 50-page briefs today. They presented diametrically opposed views of the case's legal framework as well as of the specific statutory and constitutional provisions in play.\nThe case, Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, No. 00-836, asks the court to decide if, by extending the vote-counting deadline, the Florida Supreme Court had made a retroactive change in state law that violated either a provision of federal election law or the constitutional provision that gives state legislatures authority to decide how the state's presidential electors are to be appointed.\nThe statutory provision is Section 5 of Title 3 of the United States Code, entitled ''Determination of controversy as to appointment of electors.'' It provides that if a state chooses its electors according to ''laws enacted prior to'' Election Day, then that choice ''shall be conclusive'' and the electors will not be subject to challenge by Congress.\nThe Bush legal position is based on the view that in extending the certification deadline, the Florida Supreme Court ''consciously and boldly overrode Florida's 'laws enacted prior to' Election Day and replaced them two weeks later with laws of its own invention,'' thus failing to comply with Section 5.\n''As a result of its unconstitutional arrogation of power, the Florida Supreme Court's decision is a nullity,'' the Bush brief asserts.\nThe brief for Mr. Gore argues that the Florida court ''applied garden-variety principles of statutory interpretation to resolve ambiguities and reconcile conflicting provisions within the Florida Election Code.'' In no sense did it supplant the old law or write a new one, the brief says.\nFurther, the Gore lawyers assert that the Bush position fundamentally misunderstands Section 5 as a law that requires compliance or can be violated. The provision ''does not 'require' anyone to do anything,'' the brief says, it simply offers a safe harbor to state electors chosen according to existing state procedures.\n''Because the statute does not require the states to do anything, a failure to meet the standard set out in the statute is not a ground for reversal,'' the Gore brief says, adding that ''at most,'' the consequence of a ruling that the Florida court had not complied with Section 5 ''would be to render the safe-harbor provision inapplicable, so that Florida's selection of electors might not be 'conclusive' in the event of a dispute before Congress about its electors.''\nSuch a prospect -- ''an impending constitutional crisis'' -- is one that the justices should forestall, the Bush brief warns. If the Supreme Court invalidates the Florida court action, the prospect of ''dueling slates of electors mandated by dueling branches of Florida's government is substantially diminished.''\nThere is a suggestion in the Bush brief that the campaign might have sought its own manual recounts in favorable counties had it known that the Florida court would extend the deadline ''and that local officials could adopt recount rules that favored their preferred candidates.''\nThe Gore brief, responding to a similar suggestion in the Bush team's initial filing last week -- the briefs today were filed simultaneously and so could not respond to one another -- called it ''both fanciful and disingenuous,'' noting that Mr. Bush's lawyers had rejected the Florida Supreme Court's invitation to request a statewide recount.\nThere was nothing ''retroactive'' about the Florida court's interpretation of state law, the Gore brief asserts, adding: ''Nor, finally, is there any merit to petitioner Bush's glancing contention that the Florida Supreme Court's decision violates his federal right to 'due process.' ''\nTitle 3, Section 5 of the United States Code was enacted in 1887, in response to the contested Hayes-Tilden presidential election of 1876. Despite the law's age, the Supreme Court has not had a previous occasion to interpret it.\nAccording to the Bush brief, that is ''perhaps because no candidate has previously resisted so strenuously and resourcefully the certification of election results as has Vice President Gore.'' But the Gore brief says that is because the federal provision, properly understood, places no requirements on the states and thus gives the federal courts nothing to do by way of enforcing its language.\nThe Bush brief was signed by 14 lawyers led by Theodore B. Olson of Givson, Dunn & Crutcher, an experienced Supreme Court advocate who will argue the case on Friday. The Gore brief was signed by 15 lawyers, led by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor. He has had many Supreme Court arguments and will represent the vice president."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Vice President Al Gore had just finished asking that Americans be patient while he contests Florida's decision to award its decisive 25 electoral votes to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The 10 voters who had gathered before the television in an apartment in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of this heavily Democratic city on Monday night said they felt obligated to wait.\n''I want to see Bush win, but I want to see the process play out,'' said the evening's host, Stewart Graham, a Republican who is the chief of staff for Frank Rizzo Jr., a City Council member. ''All the votes that were cast in accordance with the rules should be counted.''\nMaureen Pie-Bruno, a Democrat, said she thought the vice president had given a good speech. She had wanted him to ''take the high road,'' and he had, Ms. Pie-Bruno, the development director of a social services organization, said.\nHe was hardly electrifying, said Carol Cope, a writer and a Democrat, but she said she had long since stopped expecting Mr. Gore to be electrifying. ''Gore is Gore,'' she said. ''It was a peaceable speech.''\nThe battle over the election started just days after the Halloween decorations came down on Chestnut Hill's main street. Christmas lights and wreaths now hang on the shops and restaurants. But for all the reports of Americans losing patience over the still undecided election, these voters were in no rush for an ending. They remained riveted to the unfolding events, they said, and several had missed an important Chestnut Hill community meeting last night to catch Mr. Gore's speech.\n''I'm more passionate about democracy itself than the candidates,'' said Fernando Gallard, a Democrat, who is the head of public relations for an electronics design firm.\n''It's supposed to be the people speaking,'' Mr. Gallard said. ''We're supposed to be represented. We should wait until the votes are counted. If not, we should have another election. Why are we throwing votes away?''\nIt was a friendly, low-key evening, with Democrats and Republicans talking politics over chocolate cake and banana bread. But Jesse Walters, a Republican, did offer that he was getting tired of all the wrangling over ballots. ''I'd like to see some closure,'' Mr. Walters, the executive director of the Chester County Conference & Visitors Bureau, said.\n''When you count these ballots, there are mistakes,'' he added. ''But the vote totals rarely change. Bush seems like he's been ahead 500 to 1,000 votes for several weeks. There are close elections, and this is one of them. The system is imperfect.''\nAnd Mr. Walters, unlike almost everyone else in the room, pronounced himself ''excruciatingly bored'' with the election that never ends. While the others stayed until 11 p.m. talking politics, Mr. Walters left early to help his son with his homework.\nCurnel Bridges, a Democrat and a longtime Little League baseball coach, told the group that he views last year's championship game as the perfect metaphor for how the election should be decided.\nMr. Bridges' team, the Dodgers, had been ahead 6-2, when the game was called because of rain. It was the fifth inning, with only an inning remaining.\n''Everyone was pushing for it to be called so we could take the championship,'' said Mr. Bridges, a high school math teacher. ''But the opposing team was upset because they thought the game should have been played to completion. I knew my kids would go through the rest of the year with a taint, so I said, 'O.K., let's give them a chance. If we lose the game, we lose the game.' ''\nThe game was later continued, and the Dodgers squeaked to victory, 6-5.\nThe lesson, Mr. Bridges said: ''All the votes should be counted.''\nHe added that he hoped Mr. Gore, like the Dodgers, would prevail.\nMs. Cope had a question. ''How would your kids have felt if they'd lost?''\n''Miserable,'' Mr. Bridges said.\nHarry Johnston, a Republican, was not at Mr. Graham's apartment watching Al Gore's speech. He was at the Chestnut Hill community meeting.\nBut today he echoed Mr. Graham's sentiments.\n''I figure it has to go through the courts,'' Mr. Johnston, community manager of the Chestnut Hill Community Association, said. ''I'm prepared to wait until all the legal moves have been made and finished. I think that's important so that people don't really have any question. I don't think Gore can concede at this point. The country just has to be patient and let that process complete itself.''\nEarlier in the evening, in the Roxborough neighborhood, several miles south of Chestnut Hill, Sandy Sorlien and John Arnold were in the living room of their Victorian home, watching the latest election developments on ''The News Hour with Jim Lehrer'' on PBS.\nIn the past, they said, they had gotten their news strictly from National Public Radio, but with the press of political events, they felt compelled to add television. They also get election news through the Internet.\n''On Thursday or Friday I thought Gore should concede,'' Ms. Sorlien, a photographer and a Gore supporter, said. ''It wasn't that I didn't believe it was right to do the hand counts. I think there should have been a statewide hand count. But it began to seem as though coming to a resolution that would satisfy anybody was impossible. There was too much misinformation out there. I thought the public would never accept Gore as president.''\nHer husband, Dr. Arnold, also a Democrat, felt the same way. ''I was thinking, what the hell, let W have it,'' Dr. Arnold, a genetic researcher, said. ''Let Lieberman go back to being a senator. We need as many Democratic senators as we can get.\"\nAt some point over the weekend, Ms. Sorlien said, she and her husband decided Mr. Gore should keep fighting. ''Either there was more information coming out of Florida, or I was starting to pay more attention to some things,'' Ms. Sorlien said. ''It just seemed that the Republicans were exaggerating, and saying things that were false, and the rhetoric was really heating up. I still think if Gore prevails, he's going to have a harder time than if Bush prevails. But my principles say that shouldn't be a reason to stop fighting.''\n''What's the big rush?'' she said. ''There's no reason we need to know who the president is today as opposed to next week. There's no crisis here. Frankly, Bill could stay president for life.''\nAfter two weeks of nonstop political discussion, Thanksgiving, which they had celebrated at the house of Ms. Sorlien's brother Eric in northeast Philadelphia, was almost politics-free. ''Eric said, 'You're not allowed to talk about the election,' '' Ms. Sorlien said. ''Then someone brought it up, and his wife, who is a Republican, said, 'Well, that hand count is completely illegal.' I didn't say anything because I was instructed not to.''\n''She said, 'I know I'm not supposed to talk about this,' '' Ms. Sorlien continued. ''I said, 'Me, too,' or I would never have let that statement go.''\nAround the corner from Ms. Sorlien and Dr. Arnold's home, Kathy Turner, a Republican who voted for Al Gore, had just finished watching the network news.\n''It seems like one big mess,'' Ms. Turner, a fourth-grade teacher, said. ''I don't know what the right path to solve it is. I hate to see Gore lose all these votes that aren't counted, but I don't want to see it go on and on. I'd like to see the deadline come soon.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Senator Bob Kerrey has never had much affection for Vice President Al Gore and campaigned energetically in the primaries for his opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley. But he said it was his idea to travel to Tallahassee, Fla., last week to lambaste the Republicans and make the case for Mr. Gore.\nRepresentative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, is viewed by many in his party as having a better chance to ascend to speaker if Gov. George W. Bush becomes president and the voters rebel and elect a Democratic House in 2002. But he said it was his suggestion this week to travel to Florida with Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, to fight for Mr. Gore.\nAnd another prominent Democratic member of Congress said he had been reluctant to speak out for Mr. Gore, but decided to be a steadfast supporter. ''Gore asked, and this is his hour of need,'' he said.\nIn a striking turn that has surprised even Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, Democrats have raced to the vice president's side, more so, even, than they did in the actual campaign. These Democrats said in dozens of interviews that they were motivated by factors that have less to do with any personal concern for Mr. Gore, who was never particularly popular on Capitol Hill, even when he was in the House and Senate.\nThe unity, they said, was more a reaction to the partisanship among Republicans -- and a prevailing belief among Democrats that Mr. Gore won the election.\nTo be sure, some Democratic lawmakers said they were staying quiet -- and not willing to expend political capital on favors like traveling to Florida. But only a handful of Democrats -- Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey may be the most prominent -- have publicly or even privately questioned Mr. Gore's determination.\nThe wide belief among many Democrats was that this was a rare instance where they could be loyal while also tending to their political self-interest. Many members and Democratic officials explained that the partisan base of the party was so galvanized behind Mr. Gore that even if the vice president loses, lawmakers could score points by helping lead the charge against Mr. Bush. It is a contrast to impeachment, when Democrats who rallied behind President Clinton risked offending important segments of their supporters.\nThese Democrats also said that while some polls have shown signs that some Americans are beginning to grow restless of the stalemate -- and that they themselves may not stand by Mr. Gore forever -- for now there appears to be vigorous support for Mr. Gore's case.\n''There is a deep well of support for at least getting a fair process that is as fair as it can be,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''Even if you didn't believe in impeachment you thought what Clinton had done was wrong. It was a disagreement over the remedy. Here, all Democrats can easily agree that they would rather Gore be president than Bush and this was a razor-thin election.''\nSaying that his party was spurred on by the Republicans, Mr. Gephardt continued, ''The conservative phone tree is hard at work to create the impression that the whole country is crying out for George Bush to be president. Our members don't like that.''\nDemocrats said they were emboldened by the Republicans' behavior. They cited the planned demonstrations against vote counters in Florida; the fiery oratory from Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican whip who has proposed an effort by the House to reject electoral votes, and what many said were efforts by Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state and Bush backer, to short circuit the process.\nRepresentative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, also questioned the conduct of James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state who is overseeing the Bush legal team.\n''It starts with Tom DeLay,'' Mr. Frost said, echoing many of his colleagues. ''Then the attack by Baker on the integrity of the Florida Supreme Court.''\nSenator Charles Schumer of New York said he was outraged by orchestrated protests against vote counters in Miami-Dade County.\n''There's a terrible taste in people's mouths about what happened in Miami-Dade,'' Mr. Schumer said.\nMr. Kerrey explained that he was not acting out of any personal loyalty to Mr. Gore but because he was outraged by accusations Republicans made that Democrats were trying to avoid counting ballots of military personnel overseas.\n''It's not so much rallying behind Gore,'' he said. ''That's not as important as rallying around the legitimacy of his effort to get an accurate and complete count.''\nSeveral Democratic officials also suggested that Mr. Kerrey was among those positioning himself to run for president should Mr. Gore lose. His efforts, they said, could raise his profile and reputation as a team player.\nReferring to Mr. Kerrey's trip to Florida, one leading Democrat in Congress said, ''If you're running for president, the first thing you've got to do is win the Democratic base over, and it is a good way to do that. Democrats want you to be there.''\nWilliam M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he was pleasantly surprised by the degree of the support in the party.\n''A week ago, there was real concern on my part,'' he said. ''What changed was Baker's tough attack on the Supreme Court and Governor Bush's comments that were very tough and dismissive of the Supreme Court. And the action Wednesday in Miami Dade riled everybody.''\nOne House member from the Midwest emphasized that the outpouring was not for Mr. Gore himself. ''It's not like there is any great sympathy out there for the vice president,'' he said, ''but there is a sense that he is being treated unfairly.''\nSeveral advisers to Mr. Gore said their deepest worry now was keeping Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt on their side because if they raised questions about the vice president's case, support on Capitol Hill could unravel rapidly.\nA party official with close ties to Mr. Gephardt said that there was no down side to his position, and that it could only help if he fights for a cause that is important to the most loyal Democrats.\n''In Dick's case, we're worried about the 2002 election,'' he said. ''And in 2002, one way or another we need the base to win the House.''\nOne prominent Democratic strategist asserted that there was nothing particularly valiant about the efforts by Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle.\n''Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt may benefit if Gore doesn't win,'' he said, ''but they certainly would not benefit if they're seen as shutting him out.''\nBut Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland said people should not assume that Democrats in Congress were eager for Mr. Bush to win to help their prospects in the 2002 elections.\n''There is a belief that if Bush wins, we probably have a better shot at winning the House back two years from now,'' Mr. Hoyer said. Instead, he noted, the calculation should be that there would be a ''sense of irrelevancy'' for Democrats to control Congress ''if you don't have the presidency.''\nGore campaign officials said they were particularly heartened that many of the more moderate Democrats who had not been outspoken Gore backers, like Representative James P. Moran of Virginia and Representative Tim Roemer of Indiana, have stood by his side.\n''I've not been a predictable team player, I get off the ranch frequently,'' said Mr. Moran, who appeared on behalf of Mr. Gore today in West Palm Beach. ''To be honest with you, if Gore had not won the popular vote, not only would I not be in Florida, but I would not be involved in this. I wouldn't be undermining, but I certainly wouldn't be helping in any way.''\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California explained that the support from many lawmakers was spontaneous. ''It's springing from individuals,'' she said.\nEven so, Mr. Gore -- and Mr. Clinton as well -- have made dozens of telephone calls in recent days to try to keep the party united.\nRepresentative Roemer, for one, said that he spoke to Mr. Gore last week but that that did not affect his decision to speak out for the vice president.\n''You are always flattered when a president or a vice president takes the time to call you and wants your opinion or wants your support,'' he said. ''But I don't think it influences most members in their final determination at all.''\nEven the staunchest Gore backers said there was a limit to how long Democrats would stand behind him.\n''This cannot go on forever,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The Democrats' suit to contest the vote in Florida may have become the do-or-die battle in the legal war for the presidency, turning a Florida county court case into a decisive contest of legal strategies.\nEven with the United States Supreme Court poised to consider the Bush campaign's appeal in a separate case, the Democrats' case in Leon County Circuit Court could determine whether the Gore campaign can add to its vote totals by Dec. 12, the deadline for selecting members to the Electoral College. If Vice President Al Gore were leading on Dec. 12, he could make a claim that Florida's electoral vote belonged to him.\n''I don't think the case in the United States Supreme Court will determine who wins the election,'' said Pamela S. Karlan, an expert on election law and the Supreme Court at Stanford Law School. ''I think the Florida proceedings will.''\nEven a Supreme Court victory for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, some legal experts said, could leave room for the state courts to continue crediting additional votes for Mr. Gore.\nThat is because the Supreme Court has framed the case before it narrowly to focus on whether the Florida Supreme Court improperly extended the deadline and allowed recounts to continue before the secretary of state certified the election.\nBut whatever improprieties the justices might say occurred before certification, Florida law permits a candidate to contest an election after certification by filing a lawsuit.\nA bald denunciation of the Florida Supreme Court, which would be startling, could stall the contest lawsuit, but that would be more for symbolic reasons, some experts say.\n''If the U.S. Supreme Court says there was something wrong with the way the Florida Supreme Court dealt with the recounts done before certification, that would not invalidate the contest proceeding,'' said Jonathan R. Siegel, a professor at George Washington University Law School.\nThe Florida law gives the county judge broad powers in a contest suit. County judges have ordered recounts in contest lawsuits in the past. In the contest case, some experts said, it seems likely that the Leon County judge could even take into account recounts done before certification. That, they said, would be because the county courts have the power to conduct recounts and so could credit recounts even if they were premature.\nBecause of the importance of the Leon County case, experienced litigation lawyers said yesterday that the strategies of the two teams of lawyers could be crucial.\n''The ballgame is complexity versus simplicity,'' said Lawrence A. Mandelker, a New York election lawyer who is counsel to the Republican State Committee.\n''If you are the Democrats, you want simplicity, you want clear issues that will allow numbers of ballots in the count. If you are Republican, you want complexity,'' which would entangle the court in long deliberations.\nSimplicity is important for Democrats because if the court resolution is incomplete by Dec. 12, the Republican-controlled Legislature could decide to designate Florida's electors.\nThat means the Republicans have a classic and powerful litigation tool: the ability to delay.\nYesterday, Mr. Gore outlined an offer from his lawyers that he said had been rejected by the Bush lawyers. Mr. Gore said his lawyers offered to conduct a conclusive seven-day vote count. That represented the simplicity legal strategy.\nThe Bush lawyers countered, Mr. Gore said, with a proposed two-week schedule of court proceedings with no vote counts. That represented the complexity strategy.\nIn the maneuvering over which path the Leon County judge, N. Sanders Sauls, will choose, one claim of the Democrats could be pivotal.\nThat is the Gore campaign's request for a court-ordered count of the 10,750 ballots in Miami-Dade County that have not been counted by hand. If the judge viewed that request simply, as the Gore campaign wants, he could order an immediate count.\nThat tally would be expected to yield more votes for the vice president than for Mr. Bush. It might not yield enough votes to make Mr. Gore the winner, but it could indicate that Gore lawyers have succeeded in presenting their case as a simple one."},

Sanders Sauls, agreed to Mr. Gore's request that nearly 14,000 such ballots be sent up from South Florida, the judge's decision to call a hearing on whether to count them was a blow to efforts by Mr. Gore's lawyers to establish an accelerated timetable for contesting the election.\nThe lawyers are aware that they must wage a full-blown trial and several rounds of appeals in the two weeks before Florida sends its electors to the Electoral College, and they demanded that Judge Sauls set an extraordinarly fast schedule for the case.\nUnder their proposal, officials would have begun counting 14,000 ballots from Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties on Wednesday morning, continuing through the weekend for seven days, with a ruling from Judge Sauls next Wednesday and any appeals to the Florida Supreme Court over the next few days.\nMr. Bush's lawyers, on the other hand, proposed a more leisurely schedule, one that would have ended the trial stage on Dec. 11, the day before the designation of electors, leaving no time for any appeals.\nMr. Gore appeared before television cameras in Washington today to discuss the details of his motions, which he said was essential in ensuring a ''full and accurate count of the ballots,'' and to accuse the Republicans of deliberately stalling the process. [Page A28.]\n''They have proposed two weeks of additional court proceedings and additional hearings, right up to the Dec. 12 deadline for seating electors,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And under their plan, none of the thousands of votes that remain to be counted would be counted at all. I believe this is a time to count every vote and not to run out the clock. This is not a time for delay, obstruction and procedural roadblocks.''\nJudge Sauls, wielding folksy aphorisms to fend off the enormous pressure of the elite legal teams arrayed before him, tried to steer a middle course. He called for a hearing on Saturday to determine whether to count the ballots -- three days after the Gore team wanted the counting to begin -- and said the hearing would also take up the issue of what standards should be used to count the ballots and whether marks like dimples should be considered votes.\nTo prevent logistical delays, the judge ordered the two counties to send their ballots to Leon County Circuit Court here by Friday afternoon, though he said the order did not necessarily suggest that he intended to tabulate votes.\n''This doesn't mean in any way, shape or fashion that we're going to be counting the ballots on Saturday, unless there is a basis that dictates they should be counted,'' he said. ''But at least if we have them, we should be able to move.''\nThe judge's actions were not good enough for either side, and particularly for Mr. Gore's lawyers. David Boies, Mr. Gore's chief trial lawyer, told the judge that if he insisted on a Saturday hearing, the Democrats would immediately appeal that scheduling decision to the Florida Supreme Court.\n''We can't afford to wait till Saturday to answer these questions,'' Mr. Boies said, his usual placid, smiling demeanor showing cracks of impatience. ''Waiting until Saturday is tantamount to denying the relief we seek.''\nSpeaking to reporters later, however, Mr. Boies said he had not decided whether to appeal the Saturday hearing.\nBarry Richard, Mr. Bush's lead lawyer here, said far more time was needed to debate the question of whether the ballots should even be examined.\n''My client is entitled to a hearing before Mr. Boies's client gets relief, but every time Your Honor gives him another thing, he's back on his feet asking for one more thing you've already denied him twice,'' Mr. Richard said, visibly angry.\n''He's asking this court to give him everything he's requested, which is to begin another ballot recount before he has provided one iota of evidence or permitted my client to have one hour of hearing on whether or not he's entitled to a recount.''\nJudge Sauls, joking that he was trying to be ''unfair to everybody equally,'' said the timetable Mr. Boies was proposing would strip Mr. Bush of his basic due-process rights to respond appropriately to legal motions.\nAfter the hearing, Mr. Boies tried to put the best face on the rulings, celebrating the decision to transport the ballots but conceding that the new schedule put his team ''on a very tight leash.''\nIf the counting eventually begins, he said, it would probably have to go on 24 hours a day. Mr. Boies expressed skepticism that it could be finished in time.\n''Obviously the court is moving faster than the defendant would like but slower than we would like,'' he said. ''It's going to be a very close call.'' Mr. Boies added, ''Justice delayed here really is justice denied.''\nThough displeased with the Saturday deadline, Mr. Richard said outside the courtroom that he would work within the parameters set by the court. ''It would be appropriate to give us more time,'' he said. ''We will be as prepared as we can possibly be by Saturday.''\nThe core of Mr. Gore's contest is his belief that he would win the state's 25 electoral votes if all the disputed ballots in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties were manually recounted -- and if dimples in the punchcards were allowed to be counted as votes.\n''Why not count all the votes?'' Mr. Gore asked today. ''As I said last evening, this is America. When people vote, their votes are counted. They're not arbitrarily set aside because it's hard to count them or for whatever reason. They're counted. And these votes were cast and they have not been counted. Why not count them?''\nOn Monday, the Gore team asked Judge Sauls to order the transfer of those ballots to Tallahassee, so that they could be counted either by the judge or a special master he would appoint. But the judge postponed a ruling on that motion after Mr. Bush's lawyers objected, and at that point, the Gore lawyers say, they realized the case would not move as quickly as they had hoped.\nAs a result, the Democrats filed two motions today demanding the accelerated schedule, in particular pleading with the judge to at least begin counting the ballots.\n''The single critical issue in this case is the counting of the contested ballots,'' said one motion. ''That counting must commence now if this contest is to be resolved within the time set by the Supreme Court. In addition to the counting of 10,500 unrecorded ballots in Miami-Dade, manual recounting should be directed for the 3,300 disputed ballots in Palm Beach County.''\nTo expedite the trial, the Gore team backed away from an earlier proposal to move all the disputed ballots to Tallahassee. But in the end, the judge decided to order the elections boards in the two counties to send them up. Lawyers for both canvassing boards listened to the hearing through speakerphones and expressed concern about how the ballots would be transported with proper security. The judge told them they could use any method they liked, and the counties' officials said they would drive them up in police cars.\nMr. Bush's lawyers made it clear that they would not only fight any motion to count ballots, but also the Gore team's insistence that the ballots be counted using the most liberal standard, in which every dimple on a ballot is considered a vote.\nBoth sides said they would call witnesses to debate the mechanical workings of a voting machine, and the judge ordered the two counties to send two of the voting machines they used on Election Day, along with sample ballots and other election paraphernalia.\nJudge Sauls acknowledged that the decision on whether to count dimples would be a crucial question in the lawsuit. ''We can't have people jumping on the horse and riding off in all directions just counting,'' he said, referring to the need for a single standard for all ballot counters.\n''They can count till everyone's slap-happy, but if they're not on the same page we won't know what's being acccomplished.''\nA few blocks from the courthouse, the Florida Supreme Court was considering whether to hear two cases challenging the voting procedures in Palm Beach, where many voters said that they were confused by the ''butterfly'' ballot. One suit, filed by several Palm Beach County voters, asked the court to direct a lower court to find some remedy to troubled election, and cited three possibilities: ''a revote or new election or statistical reallocation.''\nCraig Waters, a spokesman for the court, said the request was pending.\n''The court has made no determination whether it will accept either of these cases that were filed, either the one yesterday or the one today,'' he said, adding that the judges would consider further briefs before deciding whether to hear the case."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Some people leave tickets for Elvis at sporting events. The swimmer Dara Torres leaves them for Alfonse M. D'Amato. The man once known wryly as Senator Pothole has apparently became Senator Swimming Hole.\nTorres is one of the more remarkable stories at the Olympic trials, which begin here on Wednesday. Having earned two gold medals on American relay teams, she retired after her third Summer Games in 1992 and did not swim competitively for seven years, becoming instead a fashion model, television commentator, spokeswoman for the Tae-Bo workout infomercials and the first athlete to appear in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.\nLast summer, the 6-foot, 160-pound Torres decided to resume her swimming career. She is trying to become the first American to swim in four Olympics. And in a sport often given over to teenagers, she is swimming faster than ever at age 33, having overcome the rust of a long layoff and a battle with bulimia that left her forcing herself to throw up even during the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea.\nAs she began her comeback, Torres said she met D'Amato, the former United States Senator from New York, on an airplane, and they began talking about his granddaughter's swimming achievements. They became friends, she said, and D'Amato even attended one of her meets in suburban Washington and helped her get an endorsement deal with Speedo. She got him tickets for the Olympic trials, but a business commitment will keep him away, she said.\n''He's almost like a father figure, an awesome friend,'' Torres said.\nWhat D'Amato will miss is one of the most unlikely resurgent careers in sport. It is exceedingly rare, perhaps unprecedented, for a swimmer to resume a career at an elite level seven years after having ended it. Yet, Torres this summer has set an American record of 24.73 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle and has become a medal candidate next month at the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\nTorres will swim three freestyle events and the 100-meter butterfly at the trials, which has ratcheted up the competitive tension in the women's sprints. This is where the United States has its greatest depth: Torres; Jenny Thompson, a five-time Olympic relay champion; Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics; and Angel Martino, who has won six Olympic medals over a long career.\nVan Dyken said she was very surprised at how fast Torres was able to come back. ''I think it's great for the sport,'' Van Dyken said. ''It's wonderful that she's showing people in their 30's can be better than ever.''\nFor a while, Torres trained with Thompson at Stanford University with Coach Richard Quick, who is also head coach of the United States women's Olympic team. Last December, it was decided that the two swimmers should train at different times because, as Quick said, Torres and Thompson were trying to swim an Olympic final every day in practice.\nTorres agreed with the decision.\n''If you are training for the same event, every day, twice a day, both going after the same thing and only one is going to get there, it can be very intense,'' Torres said. ''We're friends. We're not like enemies. I just think, in a way, it's better to keep us apart so there wouldn't be as much intensity in the workouts.''\nWhy the comeback? A friend had planted the seed in her head, Torres said, and it began to blossom. ''I couldn't get it out of my head,'' she said. On July 7, 1999, she jumped back into the pool, believing that her long legs and elegant stroke would serve her as well as they had early in her career. Quick took one look at her form and said, ''We don't swim like that anymore.''\nHe changed her style, having Torres look at the bottom of the pool instead of straight ahead. And he taught her to gain power from the beginning of her stroke instead of the end.\nShe hired a personal trainer and changed her diet, eating more protein for muscle enhancement instead of carbo-loading as she had in the past. She also does flexibility training that involves two men walking on her back and her legs -- mashing, she calls it -- to relax her muscles before and after she swims. The new Speedo bodysuits also help reduce drag in the water and are said to improve performances by up to 3 percent, which can be significant in races decided by hundredths of a second.\nSuch is the tarnished history of women's swimming that any spectacular performance brings the inevitable suspicion of drug use. Torres said she had spoken to Quick recently about how skepticism had come to cloud great achievement.\n''It's too bad,'' Torres said. ''Why do people have to emphasize drugs because someone does something really fast? I don't have words to describe it. It infuriates me. People think that because drugs are used so much in sport. Everyone has a conscience; for me, I know I've done everything I can do to get where I am the right way. I'm ready to swim fast.''\nTo counter cheating in the sport, Torres said, she and Thompson work with Glen Luepnitz, a physician and nutritionist who has devised a regimen of legal supplements and amino acids that produce quick recovery from hard workouts and build muscle during tapering for competitions. ''He keeps us up with people who are cheating without cheating,'' Torres said.\nAs a recovering bulimic, she admitted that she became unnerved at first when she packed 20 pounds of new muscle onto her frame. ''I don't think you're ever completely over it,'' Torres said. ''It freaked me out. Then I said, 'No, it's muscle, you need that.' Everything is in perspective.''\nAnd pointing toward a medal in Sydney."},
{"headline": null, "content": "For those of us helplessly in love with the marches of John Philip Sousa, his stage works are phantoms. The New Grove Dictionary of Opera has no entry for Sousa at all, although pieces like ''The Glass Blowers,'' played on Saturday afternoon at the Glimmerglass Opera, were busily performed and warmly received during the first quarter of the 20th century.\nSousa saw himself as America's response to Gilbert and Sullivan, and in tone and method there are similarities. ''The Glass Blowers,'' which appeared in 1913, gently mocks the issues of the day and finds in social revolution and labor reform an absurdity equal to capitalism and conspicuous consumption. There are false pairings among four lovers that are righted in the end. Plutocrats engage in stock market warfare or else gingerly experiment with factory jobs. Beefy men of various ethnic origins trumpet the rights of workers. The time is 1898, and the Spanish-American War descends on all involved.\nLeonard Liebling was not a librettist in the class of W. S. Gilbert, but his humor could be deft. Sousa may not send us the memorable melodies of Arthur Sullivan (though if we heard Sousa's more often, that impression might change), but he was a far more interesting harmonist and a marvelous craftsman. The sudden flights of modulation are done with splendid confidence and equilibrium.\n''The Glass Blowers'' is admittedly a period piece, but it is a graceful and vital one. Sousa's joy in adamant forward movement, unequivocal meter and strong downbeats carry over to his stage music. But there is here a paradox of delicacy wedded to muscle: the music sweeps one along. Perhaps too often what the ear expects happens, but there are surprises. The Glimmerglass Opera plans to bring the piece to the New York City Opera. Some will find it frivolous: a European-style operetta with a hard, bright American edge. I found it a constant pleasure.\n''The Glass Blowers'' also benefits from Christopher Alden's wise direction. Camp is at a minimum. The ridiculous -- both intentional and otherwise -- is noted but greeted with affection. John Conklin's set is a deep rectangle of glassy walls with odd little tricks of perspective. Gabriel Berry's costumes come in bright, strong blocks of color coding and feature some endearing quick-change devices. I hope John DeMain will be conducting at the City Opera too. His work had the elegance and energy missing from the wan orchestra playing at Friday night's ''Salome.'' The singing for the Sousa was by bright and attractive young performers. Maria Kanyova (Annabelle), Jennifer Dudley (Geraldine), Jeffrey Lentz (Jack) and Richard Whitehouse (the Duke) made up the quartet of confused lovers.\nAlso in the Glimmerglass repertory this summer is Puccini's ever-present ''La Boheme,'' here in an updating that places Rodolfo (Raul Hernandez), Mimi (Kelley Nassief) and the whole gang at the brink of World War I. This afternoon's offering was hardly an opera at all. Handel's ''Acis and Galatea'' from 1718 gives the bare narrative of Ovid's tale and then sends us home happy and earlier than expected. Mark Lamos's production is another update: summer sybarites in folding chairs, a large cherub reclining against a hillside and painted lavender. The singers are also dancers, and the women make a point of showing a lot of leg.\nSo slight are the theatrical possibilities that period or modern stage pictures don't really matter. I could have done without the flying beach balls and other stilted frolicking, but ''Acis and Galatea'' is about music, and Handel's here is breathtaking. Arias, duos, quartets and choruses are marvels of contrapuntal beauty. Graeme Jenkins conducted with a nice pointed energy. The singing, like the recorder and oboe parts, ask for agility. Floyd Hebert and Eileen Whalen supplied the last two with considerable virtuosity.\nThe vocal roles are not easy. Christine Brandes (Galatea) and Dean Elzinga (a Polyphemus with a miner's lamp for his one eye) were strong performers. Handel's florid detail did not sit easily for John Tessier, who sang Damon. John McVeigh's Acis suffered a little rhythmic looseness and a general reluctance to keep up with Mr. Jenkins's quick (and I think, correct) tempos. There were also pitch problems, mainly a slight but persistent sharpness.\nI hope the Glimmerglass people will think hard about exporting their ''Salome'' to New York or anywhere. It brings little credit to the company. The ingredients are fine. Andrew Jackness's set is a threatening dropped ceiling looming over a bare space. Elizabeth Byrne sings convincingly in the title role. Ned Barth as Jokanaan is even better. Kenneth Riegel and Robynne Redmon might have been an effective Herod and Herodias had they not been burdened by Leon Major's directorial concept: an amalgam of staggers, eye rollings, grimaces, fluttering fingertips and karate-chop arm wavings.\nRather than recreate Strauss's dreadful characters with some kind of intellectual and creative energy, this ''Salome'' seems to have ordered from a catalog of operatic cliches. The fact that Herodias has a drinking problem is presented to us with sledgehammer subtlety. Spear carriers and supernumeraries look sheepish. A nonopera person seeking enlightenment at Friday's performance could not be blamed for bursting into laughter and never entering the opera house again.\nMost unfortunate was the sex-kitten persona created for Ms. Byrne, a style unsuited to this otherwise admirable singer. Over Salome's famous dance on Friday let us draw an eighth veil of charity."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Hive Sweet Hive\nDorothy said it best in ''The Wizard of Oz'': there's no place like home. That's as true for a Kansas farm girl who finds herself in the Emerald City as it is for migrating animals that return to the same place year after year.\nBut social insects that migrate are not known to be particularly faithful to their home base. Except, it turns out, the Asian giant honeybee, Apis dorsata.\nPeople in southern parts of Asia who collect the bees' honey know that the same nest sites -- usually in trees or the eaves of houses -- will be occupied year after year by migrating swarms.\nNow, two reports in the journal Nature show that these nest sites are being occupied by swarms that are related. Researchers in India and Malaysia analyzed the DNA of bees found at the same nesting sites over several years.\nBoth groups found that from year to year swarms with the same queen, or with a queen that was the daughter of the previous year's queen, end up at the sites. Since worker bees live for only about two weeks, some sort of genetic mechanism must be at work, the researchers say.\nUnpredictable Comet\nComet Linear, which made its closest approach to Earth last month, was a bust in more ways than one.\nAlthough it was one of the brighter comets in years, early predictions that it would be visible to the naked eye did not pan out. The comet, which was discovered in 1999, reached a maximum magnitude of 6 to 6.5, meaning it was not bright enough to be seen without binoculars or a telescope.\nBut for professional astronomers, Linear held some surprises. For one thing, jets of gas from the comet caused slight disturbances in its orbit. Astronomers suggested that this was because Linear was probably making its first pass near the Sun. Being fresh, it had lots of ice and other compounds to vaporize as it heated up.\nBut the big surprise came around July 26, when the comet made its closest approach to the Sun. Heating of the icy core apparently became so intense that the comet started to disintegrate.\nBreakup of a comet is not unknown -- one notable example being Shoemaker-Levy 9, which broke up before it crashed into Jupiter in 1994. But that breakup left relatively large fragments. Comet Linear, on the other hand, is spewing its mass into space like a puffball in the wind, leaving nothing but dust behind. It is expected to disappear completely.\nMapping a Protein\nMuch has been made, and rightly so, about the project to sequence the human genome and the effect it will have on research into genetics and disease. But the genome, in a way, is really just a blueprint. It is the proteins that it encodes that actually do the work inside the cell. Understanding the nature of those proteins is crucial as well.\nResearchers have taken a big step in that direction, mapping for the first time the crystal structure of a type of protein called a G protein-coupled receptor. These are among the most common proteins encoded by the genome.\nThe researchers, from the University of Washington and other institutions, reported in the journal Science that they had mapped the structure of a G.P.C.R. called rhodopsin, which functions in the retina. Rhodopsin is one of the body's links to the outside world, converting light into a signal that is sent to the brain.\nUnderstanding rhodopsin's structure (which is highly complex, as the molecule contains about 350 amino acids) should help researchers to understand how it interacts with other molecules, which could eventually aid in the design of drugs to combat various eye problems.\nBut perhaps more important, since all G.P.C.R.'s have the same basic structure, knowledge of rhodopsin should help in understanding how the others function. And since the proteins play a vital role in so many areas, from the development of the embryo to the beating of the heart, understanding how they function should aid research into a variety of diseases."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Faced with a case that has much of the world's attention and could decide the presidency, Judge N. Sanders Sauls of the Leon County Circuit Court surveyed the horde of lawyers before him Monday and drawled, ''This is no different from any other litigation.''\nWhether Judge Sauls was joking or not, people who know him and his work call the remark a sign of how he will handle Vice President Al Gore's lawsuit contesting the certified results of Florida's presidential vote.\n''He will not be bullied in a courtroom by anyone,'' said Peter M. Dunbar, a prominent lawyer in Tallahassee, who was counsel to former Gov. Bob Martinez. ''He will keep things moving along, and he will not be intimidated by the magnitude of the case.''\nJudge Sauls is, by all accounts, one of the keener intellects on the state bench, yet unassuming. He brings a folksy manner to his work, telling lawyers today that they reminded him of ''the fellow who jumped on his horse and rode off madly in all directions.'' He has lived his entire life in conservative, mostly rural, north Florida, yet he has a broader range of experience than most state judges, having worked as a prosecutor, a litigator, a magistrate in federal bankruptcy court and the administrative judge for the local circuit court.\nLawyers here call Judge Sauls a judicial conservative who is loath to stray from the letter of the law. They say that Judge Sauls, a Democrat appointed by Mr. Martinez, a Republican, seems conservative politically, too, though they acknowledge that they cannot be certain.\nPeople who know Judge Sauls say that while he is gregarious outside the courtroom, he maintains a reserve that includes keeping his politics to himself.\nIn north Florida, ''just about everyone is conservative, including Democrats,'' said a lawyer, who asked that his name not be used, in part because he is an exception to that rule. ''Judge Saul's approach to criminal justice issues is more conservative than I would like, though he's a good judge,'' the lawyer said. ''But how does he vote? What's his view on affirmative action? I have no idea, and I don't think anyone else does, either.''\nJudge Sauls is unfailingly calm and courteous, preceding remarks with ''If I may,'' as if anyone would defy a judge in his own courtroom. But he uses needling humor to ride herd on lawyers. Today, seeking accord on a trial schedule, he asked, ''Has anybody even been able to agree on the time of day?'' And when Mr. Gore's lawyers pushed for an accelerated timetable, he said, ''Circuit judges in Florida, we don't go 24 hours a day.''\nDespite his usual equanimity, Judge Sauls ran into controversy two years ago, when he was chief judge of the circuit court. When the court administrator, a nonjudicial official, criticized the way Judge Sauls hired someone for another post, the judge responded by orchestrating the administrator's dismissal. Justice Major B. Harding, who was the chief justice of the state Supreme Court from 1998 until this June, citing that dispute and others, removed Judge Sauls as chief judge of the circuit.\nJudge Sauls, 59, was born in Monticello, Fla., 25 miles northeast of here. His father was a court clerk and his mother a tax assessor. He graduated from Florida State University, here in Tallahassee, then from the University of Florida's law school.\nAfter a brief stint as a prosecutor, he worked for a local litigation and lobbying firm. He served in bankruptcy court for eight years, then was resigned in 1988. A year later, Mr. Martinez appointed him to the Tallahassee-based circuit court."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The construction cranes and cement trucks are taking over the downtown here, like the artillery of a conquering army.\nSmack in the middle of the commercial district, a brick's throw from the falling-down houses that have symbolized Oakland for a generation, is the growing behemoth of an office tower -- the first to be built in the city in more than 10 years -- that promises to alter the landscape here for decades to come.\nAll around that project, dot-com businesses are plowing down old walk-ups for shiny new headquarters or swooping down on boarded-up, sad-sack buildings and restoring them to the proud, handsome office complexes they once were. In short, downtown Oakland can boast that it is within striking distance of 1.6 million square feet of offices and stores, built over the last three years.\nThat Oakland has become so popular, already facing the same space shortage, skyrocketing rents and gentrification battles that plague the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area, is an extraordinary testament to the new economy.\nThe last hot property within commutable distance of Silicon Valley has long been the plain Jane cousin to San Francisco's prom queen, never noticed except for its missteps (remember Ebonics?) and flaws. From its slums, which rival the toughest in the nation, to its reputation for high crime (a reputation not always deserved, but hard to shake) to its poorly performing schools and deteriorated housing, save for a few choice neighborhoods that prefer to call themselves something other than Oakland, the city has had a bad rap for so long that Mayor Jerry Brown likes to say it has stagnated with ''diminished expectations.''\nNow, largely because it is -- or was -- the last affordable bastion in the Bay Area, and because it has courted new residents and businesses, Oakland is feeling the ups and downs of a boom. Those celebrating include Ask Jeeves, the $1 billion Internet search company, which is one of dozens of dot-coms that have staked a claim here, with a commitment to moving at least 700 employees into its new space from the nearby city of Emeryville.\nThe Port of Oakland is getting in on the action as well, with a $727 million modernization. Forbes magazine is impressed enough to rank Oakland as No. 12 on its list of the top cities in the nation to do business, ahead of San Francisco (No. 42) and Silicon Valley's unofficial capital, San Jose (No. 29).\nBut the pressure is building along with the boom. Oakland, always considered a Bay Area haven for the poor and dispossessed, has also become the last refuge for the middle class. Nonprofit organizations, renters and house buyers alike have been leaving the overpriced, overcrowded city of San Francisco in droves. They are coming to this city of 400,000 people as their best hope for an affordable place in the Bay Area. Soon, a real estate agent said recently, ''all that will be left is the wishbone.''\nAll this new money gives Oakland an odd feel. In a scene from the new Oakland, dot-comers with Palm Pilots are sitting in Starbucks while homeless panhandlers who have lived here forever stand outside waiting to ask them for spare change. The hot real estate market is also creating a panic among members of the working class, who have made up the backbone of the city, as rents rise and renters are evicted, legally and not.\nNancy Nadel, an Oakland City Council member whose district includes much of the prime development zones, said that real estate speculation had led to a housing crisis for the poor as landlords evicted longtime tenants and, sometimes illegally, raised rents. ''As new owners acquire properties at higher prices, they are raising prices higher than our somewhat weak rent control laws allow, and evicting people illegally,'' Ms. Nadel said.\nOakland still has a lot of its old problems, too. Its crime rate, which has been dropping steadily, recently took an upturn. Poverty and homelessness, drug dealing and AIDS, all plague the city.\nAnd now, there are the new worries: skyrocketing rents, the condemnation of old buildings that have given refuge to the very poor and a growing sense of uneasiness on the part of many longtime residents, many of them African-Americans, that their city is now for sale.\n''I don't think we're getting enough attention focused on the housing needs going on here,'' said Linnie Cobb, a 62-year-old homeowner who has lived in Oakland most of her life. Ms. Cobb, who is co-chairwoman of the local chapter of Acorn, the national community advocacy organization, says she hears complaints all the time from people who wonder what is happening to their city.\n''It's bad when you have a whole community up in arms except for the yuppie types or the middle class or the rich,'' Ms. Cobb said. ''We're seeing a migration of yuppie types moving in, and blacks and minorities are being pushed out.''\nThe newcomers are the city's biggest cheerleaders. John Dolby, marketing director for the Shorenstein Company, which is building a 20-story office tower downtown, said the falling vacancy rates for prime office space -- down to 1 percent (almost as low as San Francisco's) from 9 percent last year -- reflected a changing perception among wealthy companies.\n''There was a perception of Oakland that it was crime-ridden and dilapidated, which is not the case,'' Mr. Dolby said. ''And then Jerry Brown came in and the perception is changing for the better, blocks getting cleaned up, not only downtown but surrounding neighborhoods.''\nSam Nassif, owner of the Waterfront Hotel on Jack London Square, was vice president of the city's Convention and Visitors Authority when it sputtered to a close in 1998. Now, as chairman of a revived bureau, he leads a 24-member board that can boast that Oakland's 2,000 hotel rooms are near capacity in peak times. An additional 630 rooms are slated to open in the next two years.\nA growing problem for the city is sparked by its war on decades of blighted housing. Since the city strengthened its antiblight laws two years ago and urged citizens to file complaints, it has issued 14,000 summonses for ugly nuisances, including trash cans left at the curb too long and building code violations. ''This is a very self-conscious effort at social engineering to get us on the train of economic revival,'' said Claudia Leed, a deputy city attorney.\nFor some residents, the enforcement goes too far, punishing poor people who cannot afford to repair their houses to code. Slapped with fines that start at more than $700 and quickly climb, old homeowners may be pushed out of their only option at housing. This, a growing number of ministers and community organizations say, is a part of the consequence of Oakland's newfound popularity with the rich and middle class."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Three lawyers hired by the Republican leaders of the Florida Legislature told a select committee today that the Republican-dominated body was duty-bound under the United States Constitution to promptly call a special session to name Florida's 25 electors.\nSeveral Democratic and Republican legislators agreed that today's carefully orchestrated testimony set in motion a process that virtually assures that the Legislature will meet in a special session to name its electors for George W. Bush. The Republicans hope to use the Legislature to take the decision out of the hands of Florida's courts, where Vice President Al Gore's lawyers are challenging the decision by the state canvassing commission that Mr. Bush won the state and thus its 25 electoral votes.\nEach of the lawyers argued today that such a step, unprecedented in Florida's modern political history, was required to guarantee that Florida's six million voters were represented on Dec. 18, when the Electoral College meets to select the next president. What is more, they said, the Legislature, not the Florida Supreme Court, has exclusive authority to appoint Florida's electors when the outcome of an election is in doubt because of legal challenges, including the briefs filed today by the Bush and Gore campaigns with the United States Supreme Court.

The Legislature, he added, should call a special session ''on whatever date is early enough to allow it to take decisive action in a timely fashion.''\nBut if the Legislature proceeds to choose its own slate of electors and if the courts ultimately rule that Mr. Gore won the state, Congress would be faced with having to choose between two slates of electors.\nThe Democratic and Republican legislators said the testimony would almost certainly prompt the select committee to formally recommend a special session, perhaps as early as Wednesday. This in turn would clear the way for Tom Feeney, the Republican House speaker, and John McKay, the Republican Senate president, to sign a joint proclamation calling for the session. Two senior Republican legislators said that such a gathering was likely to begin next week.\n''I think the only thing to do is a special session,'' said Johnnie B. Byrd Jr., a Republican House member who is co-chairman of the committee. ''It's the only way to take all doubt out.''\nBut Democrats charged today that the only doubt plaguing Republicans was over Mr. Bush's ability to hold on to his 537-vote victory in the Florida election. With Mr. Gore contesting the final results in three counties, and with more than a dozen other lawsuits attacking the outcome of the vote, these Democrats said that Mr. Bush was turning to the Florida Legislature as an ''insurance policy'' to guarantee him the White House.\nIf so, Mr. Bush is on highly favorable political terrain. His younger brother, Jeb Bush, the Florida governor, is closely allied with Mr. Feeney and Mr. McKay. The three men have held discussions recently about a special session, and Republicans hold a 77-to-43 margin in the House and 25-to-15 margin in the Senate.\n''I certainly hope we are not here simply because the Bush campaign needs a backup plan in the event our courts indeed require every vote in Florida to be counted,'' Tom Rossin, leader of the Senate Democrats, said at the outset of today's three-hour meeting.\nThe Legislature's Republican leaders are acutely aware of how their involvement in the election is likely to be perceived across the nation. One of their legal experts acknowledged the political risks of a special session in a Nov. 25 op-ed article in The New York Times. ''Any Bush victory that results from the intervention of the Florida Legislature or Congress, while legal, would undoubtably be questioned as driven purely by partisanship,'' Robert Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley wrote.\nHe and the other Republican legal experts who testified today presented themselves as dispassionate authorities on the Constitution who were dispensing legal advice without regard to either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore. But their conservative credentials -- and the fact that they were handpicked by legislative leaders loyal to the Bush family -- had Democrats openly seething about a ''scripted'' hearing with a pre-ordained outcome.\n''If they do what they're talking about, it will be an assault on the rule of law,'' said Dan Gelber, a Democratic House member from Miami Beach, referring to the special session. Lois Frankel, the Democratic minority leader in the House, accused the Republicans of plotting to ''steal this thing'' from Mr. Gore.\nAnd yet the Republican members took great pains today to show themselves as eager, open-minded students who simply wished to be schooled on what they often referred to as their ''rights and responsibilities.'' Not one repeated the harsh Republican allegations of recent days, allegations that have Mr. Gore secretly mapping a path to victory by disenfranchising the nation's fourth largest state.\nMr. Byrd, for one, spoke regretfully about ''partisan barriers,'' and the committee's co-chairwoman, Republican Senator Lisa Carlton, spoke soothingly about embarking on a cautious, methodical ''bipartisan process.'' One after another, the members waived their three-minute opening statements, saying they mainly just wanted to listen and learn from the assembled constitutional experts.\n''We have to be careful how this looks to the public,'' one Republican panel member said, insisting on anonymity while acknowledging the political risks inherent in going forward with a special session.\nBut their effort to appear evenhanded was undercut by the today's lineup of speakers. The only constitutional experts who spoke today were men who have strong credentials among conservative legal theorists. The first speaker, Mr. Yoo, clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas of the United States Supreme Court. Another speaker, Roger J. Magnuson, is a Minneapolis lawyer who has written extensively against gay rights.\nThe absence of lawyers with a different point of view infuriated Democrats, who were clearly unprepared to match the Republican experts even though they had been allowed to present one expert of their own. On this point, the Democrats insisted that they had been duped into believing that today's session would focus on an entirely different subject: allegations of voting irregularities across Florida.\nAs evidence of Republican trickery they pointed to the committee's unexplained name change. When formed last week, it was the Legislative Oversight Committee on Electoral Certification, Accuracy and Fairness, and its stated charge was to investigate voting irregularities among other things.\nBut today, on the meeting agenda, the committee was renamed the ''Select Joint Committee on the Manner of the Appointment of Presidential Electors.''\nThe agenda made no mention of voting irregularities. Instead, the chosen topic was constitutional law, for which the committee's Republicans were well prepared with their experts. The Democrats, meanwhile, had hired a lawyer to talk about voting irregularities. The lawyer, Bob Kerrigan of Pensacola, admitted right off the bat that he was no expert in constitutional law and that he was reduced to complaining about out-of-state ''hired guns'' lecturing the Florida Legislature as advocates for the Bush campaign.\nDemocrats, including Mr. Rossin, the party's leader in the Senate, repeatedly questioned the need for a special session now that Florida's results have been certified.\n''I'm still pretty confused,'' Mr. Rossin said. ''The only scenario which calls for the Florida Legislature to insert itself in the electoral process is if there is no valid election or no currently certified winner. We have both of those.''\nIn response, the Republicans' legal experts cited the United States Constitution, which grants state legislatures the power to appoint electors. Florida, like every other state, has decreed that its electors are to be chosen on the basis of the popular election. But under the Electoral Count Act of 1887, saying that the Legislature must step in and appoint electors if the results are in doubt, either because of an unresolved contest or because the results were produced by counting procedures that were altered after Election Day.\nBut Bruce Ackerman, a professor of constitutional law at Yale University, said today that this interpretation of the Electoral Count Act was flawed. ''I'm just stunned at their dramatic incompetence,'' he said of the Republican legal advisers."},
{"headline": null, "content": "George Steinbrenner's Rotisserie baseball executives woke up last Thursday, found out that Jose Canseco was available on the waiver wire and inexplicably pounced on him. So the Yankees started the process that forced them to add the player that Steinbrenner has always adored, a player with bulging biceps, with Page Six possibilities and with a flickering marquee name.\nWhy? Why did the Yankees need a 36-year-old player who does not own a glove, who lumbers around the bases as if he is playing slow-pitch softball and who is such a productive home run hitter this year that he has four more than Clay Bellinger? The Yankees should have given the dangerous choice deeper thought since Canseco fits them as comfortably as Madonna would fit in as a librarian.\nBut General Manager Brian Cashman knows how Steinbrenner operates, and he knows that Steinbrenner would probably have shouted in his ear if another team claimed and got Canseco. Cashman claimed Canseco and 47 other players last Thursday to block opponents and, for worse, not better, the Yankees wound up stuck with Canseco when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays let him go yesterday to save slightly less than $1 million.\nA decision that is made to pacify Steinbrenner is not always logical, and this one was not. Cashman and the Yankees made their first error in two months, a blunder that will not help a team that has been carefully remodeled to ensure that a third straight World Series title remained possible.\nSteinbrenner spoke deliberately during a telephone interview yesterday and was reluctant to answer several questions about how Canseco became a Yankee. The owner sounded as exasperated as Cashman and Manager Joe Torre about the stunning and unnecessary addition of Canseco.\n''I think they got caught up in something they didn't think about,'' Steinbrenner said. ''But I'm behind my people. I'm totally supportive of what they did. I'm happy the man is coming here, and I hope he does the job for me.''\nThese are not your 2000 Yankees from spring training. These are your 2000 Yankees from today, born of many changes that have given an aging team with flaws a better chance to survive through October. Until yesterday, Cashman and Mark Newman had made flawless decisions.\nThey scooped up Denny Neagle and David Justice long before the nonwaiver trading deadline. They made a smart move to acquire Jose Vizcaino. They rescued and revived Dwight Gooden and they added some power in Glenallen Hill, who is better than Canseco. The Yankees also made a $66,000 investment in Luis Polonia last week. A few hours after the Canseco deal, they obtained the former Yankee Luis Sojo from Pittsburgh because Chuck Knoblauch was disabled, another shrewd trade. But the Canseco claim was terrible, reducing Torre to a succession of ''I don't knows'' about Canseco's role.\n''I'm a little stunned,'' said Torre, who made no attempt to disguise his disgust. ''I don't get surprised very often. I was a little surprised.'' Cashman added, ''We got him so now, hopefully, he can fit in.''\nWhen Polonia was signed, a nervous Ryan Thompson asked a reporter if he would be bounced off the 25-man roster. Thompson was not, but he will find out today that he has been sacrificed to make room for Canseco.\nThis is senseless because Thompson is a stellar defensive outfielder who can play all three positions. Now Thompson will be jettisoned for a designated hitter who might be a designated pinch-hitter in the Bronx. Without Thompson, who plays center field if Bernie Williams is injured? Obviously, Canseco, who joked that he could play shortstop or third base, makes the Yankees much less flexible until the rosters expand on Sept. 1 and might give them as many D.H.'s as starting pitchers.\n''I really don't know how I'm going to fit in with the New York Yankees,'' admitted Canseco, a walking, talking distraction who longingly said he would like to be the full-time D.H. ''I just know that I'm a New York Yankee.''\nCashman leaned back in his office chair last Thursday night, with the bags under his eyes drooping like hammocks, and talked about how stressful the waiver period can be. A general manager must gamble, not only trying to make his team better, but also trying to prevent other teams from improving. When Harold Baines went from Baltimore to Cleveland in the waiver period last year, a move Cashman could not block, Steinbrenner went ballistic.\n''Sometimes,'' Cashman said, ''I hate this.''\nStill, even if another team wanted Canseco, the Yankees should not have cared. This was Canseco, not John Wetteland or Pedro Astacio. Canseco has 440 career homers and was a potent slugger as recently as 1998 with 46 homers, but he has a fatigued body and has struck out once every 3.4 at-bats this year. Too bad Steinbrenner's passion kept the Yankees from ignoring Canseco.\nCanseco will show up at Yankee Stadium today, 12 years after he hit 42 homers and was the American League's most valuable player. He becomes a more muscular Wilson Delgado on a team that did not need him, a team whose owner has long been intrigued by Canseco and is now stuck with an albatross. Why, George, why?\n''I've always liked Canseco,'' admitted Steinbrenner, an admiration that made Cashman react and brought the Yankees a 240-pound nuisance."},
{"headline": null, "content": "Most of the sites where the federal government built nuclear bombs will never be cleaned up enough to allow public access to the land, and the plan for guarding sites that are permanently contaminated is inadequate, the National Academy of Sciences said today in a report.\n''At many sites, radiological and nonradiological hazardous wastes will remain, posing risks to humans and the environment for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years,'' the report said. ''Complete elimination of unacceptable risks to humans and the environment will not be achieved, now or in the foreseeable future.''\nThe idea that the production of nuclear weapons has produced ''national sacrifice zones,'' land that the public can never use again, is not new. The term became common in environmental circles in the late 1980's, when the United States began recognizing the environmental legacy of the Manhattan Project, the effort during World War II to develop atomic weapons, and the cold war.\nBut the report, commissioned by the Department of Energy, goes a step further. It says that the government can try to declare certain areas permanently off-limits, but that it lacks the technology, money and management techniques to prevent the contamination from spreading.\nIn addition, some of the contaminants have already ''migrated'' outside plant boundaries and others will follow, the report said.\nThomas M. Leschine, the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, said managers could use barbed wire and guards at the sites.\nBut Dr. Leschine, an associate professor in the School of Marine Affairs at the University of Washington, added: ''There's no assurance that we can maintain any of that control. It's one thing to put a fence up around something, but it's really something else to maintain it in perpetuity.''\nControls on the use of some of the land are already breaking down, the report said. For example, in the early 1990's, the Department of Energy sold land near its Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee for use as a golf course, stipulating that the groundwater was contaminated and was not to be used. ''Within a few years, however, D.O.E. discovered that a well was being drilled to irrigate the golf course,'' the report said.\nDr. Leschine said the committee had found another case in which the Department of Energy had posted ''no fishing'' signs at a creek near Oak Ridge because of radiation contamination in the water.\n''The signs all got stolen, because the local high school kids thought they were nice things to have,'' he said. ''Then there were months of protracted battles between the local authorities and the Department of Energy, over whose responsibility it was to replace the signs.''\nAt the Department of Energy, Gerald G. Boyd, the deputy assistant secretary for science and technology, said his agency established a long-term stewardship office a year ago to cope with the problem, with about a dozen people working with engineers and planners at the various sites. The office was established soon after the department requested the study from the National Academy of Sciences, Mr. Boyd said.\nThe department has accelerated its clean-up efforts, reduce the costs involved and minimize risks to surrounding communities, but a perfect cleanup is not possible, he said.\nAs an example of the breakdown of control, Dr. Leschine cited the fire that endangered the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, in May. The fire set the stage for mud slides in the coming rainy season that could contaminate the Rio Grande with radioactive and chemical toxins from the laboratory.\nBut the cause of the blaze was not natural or malicious; the fire was set by another government agency as part of its land-management efforts.\nThe report said that no plan written now to minimize the spread of uncontained wastes would suffice over the tens, hundreds or even thousands of years that some of the contaminants would remain dangerous.\nIt urged the department to assume that engineered barriers like concrete and steel would eventually fail, and that most of what was known about the behavior of contaminants in air, soil or water might ''eventually be proven wrong.'' The department needs a long-term program that ''actively seeks out and applies new knowledge,'' the report said.\nThe report identified 144 sites where the department and its predecessors, notably the Atomic Energy Commission, processed nuclear materials, and it said that 109 would not be cleaned up enough for unrestricted release, because of insufficient money, technical skill or political will to do the job."},
{"headline": null, "content": "The two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to be host to the 2002 Winter Olympics pleaded not guilty yesterday to federal charges that they had conspired to bribe members of the International Olympic Committee.\nThe defendants, Tom Welch, former president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, and Dave Johnson, his chief deputy, said they were eager to defend themselves in federal district court. A trial date was set for Oct. 16 in Salt Lake City, but defense lawyers said they would ask for a delay of up to a year to gather evidence.\nWelch and Johnson maintain that they violated no laws in paying more than $1 million to I.O.C. delegates and their families in the form of cash payments, scholarships, medical treatment and expensive gifts. The two have repeatedly said they were simply conducting business that had become customary for cities bidding on the Winter and Summer Games. Their lawyers have indicated that they want a delay in the trial so they can question I.O.C. delegates to show that it was common to shower them with exorbitant favors.\nThe two bid officials have also said they acted with the knowledge of the Salt Lake City business and political community. Evidence uncovered in news reports last year clearly indicated that there was widespread awareness of at least some of their activities. A trial could prove extremely embarrassing to the community and its leaders as they prepare to play host to the 2002 Winter Games in 18 months.\nWelch and Johnson face one count of conspiracy to bribe, five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. The charges carry a maximum of 75 years in prison.\n''We did not do anything that violated the law,'' Welch told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City. ''We did not do anything that other cities hadn't done. We didn't do things that should embarrass this community. I think that not only will we be vindicated and found not guilty, but history will put it in perspective.''\nThe defense case would implicate hundreds of Olympic officials, Utah politicians and business leaders, Johnson told reporters. Explaining his and Welch's actions, Johnson said that people should understand the bidding culture that had developed in obtaining the Olympic Games.\n''We were involved in a culture a lot of people don't understand,'' Johnson said. ''Most people haven't been out of this country. There are people that live differently than we do and make decisions different than we do.''\nWelch, 55, and Johnson, 41, have said the cash payments were made to help impoverished athletes in developing nations. However, evidence has shown that a good deal of the money went directly into the pockets of I.O.C. delegates. Ten resigned or were forced out of their positions last year. In an effort to reform the bidding process, I.O.C. members are now forbidden to visit cities bidding on the Olympic Games.\nAbout 30 of the I.O.C.'s 113 delegates have been implicated in some form of misconduct, whether it be large or small, regarding bidding on the Games. Revelations have shown that similar bidding practices occurred in other successful bid cities, including Atlanta, Sydney, Australia, and Nagano, Japan.\nPerhaps the thorniest charge facing Welch and Johnson concerns $130,000 from a New York travel agency, Jet Set Sports, that prosecutors say the two men diverted for personal use. Lawyers for Welch and Johnson said the money was used for bidding purposes. Jet Set Sports later became an official travel agent for the 2002 Winter Games."},

He earned Pro Bowl berths in 1998 and 1999.\nThe starting tailback, Priest Holmes, is backed up by the undrafted rookies Robert Arnaud and Jason Brookins. The first-round pick Jamal Lewis is still out with a dislocated left elbow and is not expected back until the Sept. 3 opener at Pittsburgh.\nBUFFALO\nMarcellus Wiley surprised the Bills by returning to practice yesterday, just four weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a bulging disk in his lower back. The Bills' starting right defensive end -- the projected replacement for Bruce Smith -- was expected to be sidelined six weeks.\nWiley said: ''This week I'll start to tune up. Next week I'll probably go all live stuff, hopefully if the back responds well. I'm pain free.''\nWiley said he did not expect to play in the Bills' next two preseason games, and was 50-50 for the final exhibition at Philadelphia Aug. 24. He said he should be ready for the regular-season opener against the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 3.\nDENVER\nAny animosity between Trevor Pryce and Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan was put aside yesterday when the two talked for the first time since the All-Pro defensive tackle ended his holdout last week. ''He met me at the door with a smile and a handshake, and I did the same with him,'' Pryce said.\nPryce, scheduled to make $762,000 this season, is in the fourth year of a five-year, $4.9 million contract. He reported to training camp last Friday after rejecting a seven-year, $31.5 million offer.\nPryce's holdout became contentious as the Broncos fined him $5,000 for every day he missed practice. After meeting with Shanahan in the morning, Pryce was back with the starting unit. He practiced alone over the weekend and hopes to play in Saturday's preseason game against the Green Bay Packers.\nDETROIT\nDefensive end Robert Porcher was excused from practice yesterday so that he could mull over an offer of a long-term deal. The Lions made Porcher the offer late Sunday and Porcher was meeting with his agent, Ricky Lefft.\nPorcher -- the team's designated franchise player -- signed a one-year tender offer for $4.253 million. Porcher, who held out for six months, had to accept the tender for the upcoming season before negotiations could begin on a long-term deal.\nMIAMI\nJay Fiedler, who was competing with Damon Huard for the job as Dan Marino's quarterback replacement with the Dolphins, is recovering rapidly from arthroscopic hip surgery and hopes to play in Miami's final exhibition game Aug. 25 against New Orleans.\nFielder, who underwent surgery last Thursday, is already riding a bicycle and swimming and is pain-free for the first time in weeks.\n''Right now we're shooting for that last preseason game,'' he said yesterday. ''That's our goal, and it looks like we're on schedule.''\nThe injury, which had bothered Fielder since last spring, temporarily ended the battle to succeed Marino. Huard is expected to start the first game, Sept. 3 against Seattle.\nBut Fiedler, who signed with Miami as a free agent in March, still expects to play this year. ''It's a long season,'' he said. ''No matter who was going to get the starting job from the beginning, there are very few quarterbacks who last 16 games. The backup is going to be needed at some point.''"},
{"headline": null, "content": "Despite its image of arcane intellectuality, particle physics is fast becoming a field with plenty of heart-pounding, high-stakes suspense. The reasons lie not so much in the field's recent string of discoveries as in how some of them were made.\nSeveral large, multinational teams of particle physicists, who design experiments to capture, measure and understand the most elementary building blocks of matter, have adopted an analysis technique that may best be compared to walking a tightrope while blindfolded.\nThey hope the technique will help them overcome their problems with particle ''discoveries'' that turn out to be wishful thinking and with conflicting results that take decades to resolve.\nThe problem is bias, and it plagues all realms of scientific experimentation. In medicine, finding statistically beneficial or disease-causing effects is part of the fabric of research, and blind studies have been used for decades.\nThat approach has been difficult to apply to physics, with its emphasis on discrete effects, from nuclear fission to superconductivity. But in some cases it can be used in particle physics, where detectors collect huge numbers of interactions in order to find a few unusual events or slight differences in behavior between two types of particles.\nRecently, somewhat in the spirit of biomedicine, research teams in particle physics have been programming their computers to add unknown numbers, called ''offsets,'' to their data to make the outcome of their analyses blind. When an experiment is over, the researchers open their metaphorical sealed envelopes and discover what the value of the offset is -- learning only then whether they are close to a routine confirmation of theory, a Nobel Prize or a humiliating mistake.\nIn some cases, much of the data are ordinary and irrelevant, and physicists must painstakingly winnow them for a few rare particle decays -- events so precious that physicists refer to them as ''golden.'' In other cases, physicists must find tiny differences in millions of decays of two different types of particles.\nThe problem is, physicists' natural eagerness to find new effects may lead them, in all innocence, to pare the data or make the comparisons in slightly biased fashion if they can see the answer as they work. Offsets are designed to prevent that, because they obscure the bottom line as all those choices are being made.\nThe teams agree ahead of time to operate completely in the dark during months of analysis and then to announce publicly whatever results pop out when the cloak is removed.\nDr. Eric Prebys, a particle physicist at Princeton, who is a member of a large collaboration called Belle, said scientists ''always want a particular outcome -- whatever they say.'' Removing all landmarks is the only sure way to insulate them from their own hopes and expectations, he said.\n''Obviously, it takes a little bit of courage to do it,'' Dr. Prebys said.\nIn fact, the queasy moments of suspense have been followed by surprise in more than one recent case. That is just the point, advocates of the method say: there is no chance to redo the analysis just because the answer looks odd.\nThe practice can be a salve for physicists who simply want to get on with the analysis without worrying about what their subconscious minds might be doing.\n''Psychologically, it's better,'' said Dr. Bruce Winstein, a physicist at the University of Chicago and a member of an experiment team at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which used the technique in work on the decaying of particles called kaons. The results were announced last year. ''There's no concern about, 'Do we agree with our old experiment? Do we agree with the Standard Model?' '' -- the theory that that contains theorists' best understanding of the structure of all matter.\nThe reward, said Dr. Aaron Roodman, a physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center who is a member of the large team called BaBar, is better science and a few thrills for the physicists who are present when the offset is revealed, and the experiment is judged either routine or groundbreaking.\nBoth the Belle team, centered at the KEK high-energy physics laboratory in Japan, and the BaBar team, based at the Stanford accelerator site, announced preliminary new results last week after using the blind technique, and both had surprises. The experiments tried to measure a difference, or asymmetry, in the rates at which particles of matter and antimatter decayed. The crucial parameter is called sine-two-beta, a number that would be zero in a perfectly symmetric universe and either positive or negative otherwise.\nWith the Standard Model predicting a value for sine-two-beta of between 0.5 and 0.85, BaBar's result came in positive but unexpectedly low: 0.12. Belle had two separate values corresponding to different types of decays. One of the values, 0.8, raised no eyebrows. But when the other blind result came ''out of the box'' a shocker: a negative 0.6, nowhere near what anyone had predicted.\n''The reaction among some people was, 'Could we find a way not to include the result?' '' Dr. Prebys said. Then they remembered their pledge to change nothing once the answer was revealed. Belle finally merged the two data sets, as planned, and came up with a middle-of-the-road value of 0.45.\nWithout the blind analysis, the team would almost certainly have searched exhaustively for flaws to justify dropping the deviant result, he said. And even though all the Belle and BaBar numbers still have wide error bars and are considered preliminary, the incident ''shows how these biases creep in,'' Dr. Prebys said.\nHuman bias has a long, unhappy history in scientific research. In retrospect, some of Gregor Mendel's data on heritable traits was probably too good to be true, but the great Austrian geneticist knew what he was seeing and may simply have discarded some data that did not fit.\nSir Arthur Eddington, the British astrophysicist, probably did the same thing with his team's measurements of the deflection of starlight over the edge of the sun in 1919. But his results fit the predictions from Einstein's theory of relativity, which Sir Arthur was championing at the time and which turned out to be correct.\n''We now think that his photographic plates weren't as stable as he thought,'' said Dr. Spencer Weart, director of the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics. ''Which isn't to say that a person who's a great scientist like Eddington isn't entitled to some bias.''\nScientists who are either less skilled or less lucky have had harsher experiences with bias. In the 1980's, scientists at the Organization for Heavy-Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, convinced themselves that they had established to a statistical certainty of 99.9999 percent that they had discovered either a bizarre new particle or some other unpredicted event. But the particle evaporated when physicists tried to find it in other laboratories.\n''If you think there's something there and you're very committed to looking for it, you may lull yourself into saying, 'Gee, I've found it,''' said Dr. Michael S. Lubell, chairman of the physics department at City College of New York, who searched for the particle in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nAs a result, many physicists have learned to take precautions, especially when searching for rare events amid the confusion of a much greater number of ordinary processes. In such cases, it is only by carefully subtracting events with, say, the wrong energy or mass or decay products that the few golden events emerge. Mistakes or biases in the subtraction can either erase those events or fail to remove all of the meaningless background.\nDr. Tatsuya Nakada, a physicist at the University of Lausanne and CERN, a European particle physics laboratory, both in Switzerland, said that one effective way to wipe out biases was to let several subgroups analyze the data independently and then compare notes. ''If they disagree, they discuss why they disagree,'' and work out the kinks, he said.\nAnother common method, he said, is to place a sort of mask over the part of the data in which rare decays would be hiding among the background, if they were there. Criteria, often called ''cuts,'' are established that eliminate the visible background, and then the mask is removed. Anything that remains is golden.\nThe recent experiments at KTeV -- for Kaons at the Tevatron, the Fermi experiment in which Dr. Winstein was involved -- as well as Belle and BaBar took blind analysis a step further, actually showing researchers false numbers as they refined their analysis of the data. As it happened, all three experiments were seeking to measure the matter-antimatter asymmetry, although KTeV was looking at decaying of kaons while the others looked at B mesons, another particle.\nAt KTeV, Dr. Peter Shawhan, a collaborator at California Institute of Technology, wrote a computer program that converted a text string into a number in a horribly complex way that only the computer could reproduce. The string was entered, and the number became an unknown offset in all calculations of their measure of the asymmetry during the analysis.\nThe BaBar team had an unknown offset, but also shuffled the raw data in plots used by the team so that no advance hint of the asymmetry would be revealed, Dr. Roodman said. Belle used its own shuffling procedure.\nLike Belle and BaBar, the KTeV result was not what the team had expected. (And like the others, it still contained a wide uncertainty. Dr. Roodman believes the ultimate use of the blind analysis will be to squeeze those inaccuracies to the extreme.)\nWhen asked for his reaction when the result came out of the box, he said it had been an expletive followed by ''What did we do wrong?''\nThe asymmetry was larger than expected from theory. KTeV published the result."},

{"headline": null, "content": "An unusual proportion of crib deaths occur in child care centers, especially those in homes where care givers may not know to put babies to sleep on their backs, a study has found.\nCrib death, or sudden infant death syndrome, kills as many as 7,000 American babies annually.\nThe report, written by Rachel Moon, a pediatrician at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, and published in the journal Pediatrics, examined 1,916 SIDS cases from 1995 to 1997 and found that 12 percent occurred in home child care settings, 3 percent in day care centers, 4 percent in a relative's home, and 1 percent with a baby-sitter or nanny. The rest occurred while the baby was under family supervision.\nAfter findings in 1992 that babies who slept on their bellies were at greater risk for SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics began a campaign to promote back sleeping."},
